Characterise key aspects of human-computer interaction, such as interaction design, the user experience, and user interfaces.
Differentiate between design paradigms, approaches, and methods and explain their applicability to different design contexts.
Investigate the activities and practices of a design space using design research methods, to identify opportunities and issues for design intervention.
Ideate, prototype, and evaluate novel technology design ideas and their use in context.
Critically reflect on the role of technology in society, including issues of power, agency, and representation in design.
