Offensive Cyber Security operations introduces and exercises a complete range of reverse engineering techniques and attack patterns. Students will also learn and exercise analysis of systems based on minimal information. 
This is a complete course in cyber attacks which enables students on successful completion to identify and test systems for vulnerabilities without full knowledge or direct access.
Demonstrate a thorough understanding of the fundamental principles underlying the identification and testing for vulnerabilities with limited information.
Analyze a system across all abstraction levels, from basic hardware to complex cloud architectures.
Run cyber attacks, tests and probes in a practical context.
Expand conventional attack patterns to work in new system and network architectures.
Communicate a cyber security vulnerability and potential paths of attack to a heterogenous team of professionals.
