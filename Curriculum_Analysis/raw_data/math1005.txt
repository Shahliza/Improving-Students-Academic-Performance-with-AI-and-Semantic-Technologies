Introduction to discrete mathematics and its use in mathematical modelling.
Emphasis will be placed on developing facility, technique and use in applications.
Modelling of processes and phenomena which occur in the physical, environmental and life sciences, especially computer science, will be used as a vehicle throughout.
Topics to be covered include: logic and set theory, mathematical reasoning, combinatorics and counting, mathematical induction and recurrence relations, graph theory and networks, matrix arithmetic and Markov chains.
Recall, invent, interpret examples of motivation for mathematical constructs used in discrete mathematics as models of processes in the world.
Recognise, define, explain and use terminology and notation from discrete mathematics.
Identify the logical structure of a statement, and then identify the logical structure of an argument that may be used to prove or disprove the statement.
Perform mathematical calculations in discrete mathematics using methods presented in the course.
Write simple proofs/construct explicit counterexamples for statements relating to discrete mathematics topics covered in the course.
