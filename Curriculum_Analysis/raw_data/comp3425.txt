Massive amounts of data are being collected by public and private organisations, and research projects, while the Internet provides a very large source of information about almost every aspect of human life and society. 
Analysing such data can provide significant benefits to an organisation. 
This course provides a practical focus on the technology and research in the area of data mining. 
It focuses on the algorithms and techniques and less on the mathematical and statistical foundations.

Anticipate and identify data issues related to data mining.
Test and apply the principal algorithms and techniques used in data mining.
Justify suitable techniques to use for a given data mining problem.
Appraise and reflect upon the results of a data mining project using suitable measurements.
Reflect upon ethical and social impacts of data mining.
