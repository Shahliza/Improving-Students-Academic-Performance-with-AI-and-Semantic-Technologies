Society relies on many complex systems of interacting technology, people, processes, laws and other elements. Examples of such systems include air transport, telecommunications and energy supply. 
Systems Engineering is a holistic, multi-disciplinary and well established approach to the engineering of these complex systems. 
Because software is a critical component of such systems, Software Engineers will often work in Systems Engineering teams. 
Systems concepts.
The Systems Engineering life-cycle and processes.
Conceptual system design: including problem definition, technical performance measures, quality function deployment (QFD), trade-off analyses, and system specification.
Preliminary system design: subsystem design requirements, design review.
Detailed design and development: Detailed design requirements and design engineering activities; review and feedback, and incorporation of design changes.
Design testing, evaluation and validation.
Design for sustainability: approaches that integrate sustainability principles into the design process.
Integration of Systems Engineering and Software Engineering activities.
describe the holistic and multi-disciplinary nature of complex engineering projects.
describe the Systems Engineering life-cycle.
identify and explain the activities involved in each phase of the Systems Engineering life-cycle.
explain the role of Software Engineering within the broader context of Systems Engineering.
Students will also improve their ability to understand and solve complex and ill-defined problems.
Students will also improve their ability to communicate with the multi-disciplinary engineering team and the community at large.
Students will also improve their understanding of and commitment to ethical and professional responsibilities.
Students will also improve their ability to function as an individual and as a team leader and member in multi-disciplinary and multi-cultural teams.
