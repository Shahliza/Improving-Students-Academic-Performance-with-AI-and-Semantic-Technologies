This course provides basic approaches for designing and analysing algorithms and data structures. 
It will focus on two fundamental problems in computing: Sorting and searching. 
It will cover various data structures and algorithm design techniques for solving these two classes of problems, as well as basic performance measures and analysis techniques for solving such problems.
Display an advanced understanding of a variety of algorithms, including linear selection, minimum spanning trees, single source shortest path, Huffman coding, etc, with real-life applications and the resource requirements.
Expertly apply the most effective algorithmic techniques including dynamic programming, greedy policy, and divide-and-conquer, to solve some practical problems.
Define and analyse time and space complexities of algorithms.
Demonstrate experience in the design and implementation of algorithms for practical problems, using languages like C, C++.
