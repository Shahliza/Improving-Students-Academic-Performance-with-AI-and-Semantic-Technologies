0.8877,"This course aims to provide students with sufficient knowledge of the basic principles of software project management that they may support a project manager to carry out the project administrative functions of a program office, understand leadership and management within the context of an agile project development team, and understand the context in which project management is conducted.","The following areas of study constitute the backbone of the course. Predicate calculus and natural deduction, inductive definitions of data types as a basis for recursive functions and structural induction, formal language theory (particularly regular expressions, finite state machines and context free grammars), and specification languages."
