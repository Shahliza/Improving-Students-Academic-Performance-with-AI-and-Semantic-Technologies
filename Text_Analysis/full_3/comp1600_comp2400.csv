0.9133,This course is an introduction to relational databases and the general skills for designing and using them.,"This course presents some formal notations that are commonly used for the description of computation and of computing systems, for the specification of software and for mathematically rigorous arguments about program properties."
0.9243,"The topics include the relational data model, SQL, entity-relationship model, functional dependencies, (de-)normalisation, relational algebra, query processing and optimisation, database transactions and security.","The following areas of study constitute the backbone of the course.
