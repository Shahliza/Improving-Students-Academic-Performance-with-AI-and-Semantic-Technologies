0.9370,"This course studies the standard models for the layered approach to communication between autonomous machines in a network, and the main characteristics of data transmission across various physical link types.","The course includes a deeper treatment of data structures, using hash tables, trees and lists, which are used to provide concrete implementations of abstract library collection types."
0.9439,"It considers how to design networks and protocols for diverse situations, analyses several application and support protocols from a distributed systems viewpoint, and identifies significant problem areas in networked communications.","Develop, understand, test, and evolve substantial programs using a modern IDE, and associated configuration tools; understand common coding errors and how to avoid them; practice fundamental defensive programming; perform individual and team program reviews; use established design principles to organize a software system."
0.9171,"Topics include: communication network architectures, signalling and modulation across physical media, real-world local and wide-area networks, internet protocol fundamentals, performance and monitoring of networks, routing, network security, and application protocols for distributed systems including web, email, video, internet-of-everything and other contemporary network topics.","Develop, understand, test, and evolve substantial programs using a modern IDE, and associated configuration tools; understand common coding errors and how to avoid them; practice fundamental defensive programming; perform individual and team program reviews; use established design principles to organize a software system."
