0.9135,"This course takes a detailed look at the services provided by, and the internals of, an existing operating system to see how each part is constructed and integrated into the whole.","This course continues to build on topics taught in the previous two courses. It focuses on construction of medium scale programs, using design patterns and tools that are used in the software development process."
0.9261,The lectures will also address recent literature describing advances in operating systems.,The course also treats intellectual property considerations in software development and deployment.
0.9323,"The following topics are addressed: system programming and its facilities (including I/O, signals, job control, interprocess communication, sockets, transport layers, remote operations), system calls and their relation to the system libraries, process management and coordination, implementation of message passing, memory management, interrupt handling, real-time clocks, device-independent input/output, serial-line drivers, network communication, disk drivers, deadlock avoidance, scheduling paradigms, file systems, security.","Students will learn appropriate application of programming abstractions they have learned in previous courses to the structuring of medium scale software: inheritance, generic types, polymorphism, procedural abstraction, and abstract recursive data structures (including abstract syntax trees as a program representation, and tools that manipulate them)."
0.9376,"identify and evaluate features of the system library of a particular operating system, and be able to apply this knowledge to program small applications.","Describe contractual specifications, analyse documentation and specifications against otherâ€™s code, develop, understand, test, and evolve substantial programs using a modern IDE, and associated configuration tools; explain the importance of correctness for quality software; understand common coding errors and how to avoid them; practice fundamental defensive programming; understand principles of secure design."
0.9137,describe and analyse the actual algorithms and data structures that are used in a particular operating system.,"Students will learn appropriate application of programming abstractions they have learned in previous courses to the structuring of medium scale software: inheritance, generic types, polymorphism, procedural abstraction, and abstract recursive data structures (including abstract syntax trees as a program representation, and tools that manipulate them)."
0.9191,"define and analyse the structure of operating systems in general, especially those that support communicating processes.","Understand, apply, and analyse state and state machines in expressing computations."
0.9196,identify and describe the reasons for many architectural features of contemporary machines.,Apply fundamental programming concepts for medium scale programs.
0.9327,demonstrate experience in the design and implementation of a large software system.,The course also treats intellectual property considerations in software development and deployment.
