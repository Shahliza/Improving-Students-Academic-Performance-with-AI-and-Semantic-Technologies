0.9336,This course provides basic approaches for designing and analysing algorithms and data structures.,describe and analyse the actual algorithms and data structures that are used in a particular operating system.
0.9022,It will focus on two fundamental problems in computing: Sorting and searching.,The lectures will also address recent literature describing advances in operating systems.
0.9208,"It will cover various data structures and algorithm design techniques for solving these two classes of problems, as well as basic performance measures and analysis techniques for solving such problems.",describe and analyse the actual algorithms and data structures that are used in a particular operating system.
0.9115,"Display an advanced understanding of a variety of algorithms, including linear selection, minimum spanning trees, single source shortest path, Huffman coding, etc, with real-life applications and the resource requirements.","The following topics are addressed: system programming and its facilities (including I/O, signals, job control, interprocess communication, sockets, transport layers, remote operations), system calls and their relation to the system libraries, process management and coordination, implementation of message passing, memory management, interrupt handling, real-time clocks, device-independent input/output, serial-line drivers, network communication, disk drivers, deadlock avoidance, scheduling paradigms, file systems, security."
0.9084,"Expertly apply the most effective algorithmic techniques including dynamic programming, greedy policy, and divide-and-conquer, to solve some practical problems.","identify and evaluate features of the system library of a particular operating system, and be able to apply this knowledge to program small applications."
0.9201,Define and analyse time and space complexities of algorithms.,"define and analyse the structure of operating systems in general, especially those that support communicating processes."
0.9291,"Demonstrate experience in the design and implementation of algorithms for practical problems, using languages like C, C++.","identify and evaluate features of the system library of a particular operating system, and be able to apply this knowledge to program small applications."
