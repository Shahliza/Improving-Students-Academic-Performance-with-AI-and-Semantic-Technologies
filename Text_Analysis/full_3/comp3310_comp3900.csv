0.9187,"This course will provide an introduction to the field of Human-Computer Interaction and will introduce students to key interaction and experience design paradigms, approaches and methods.","It considers how to design networks and protocols for diverse situations, analyses several application and support protocols from a distributed systems viewpoint, and identifies significant problem areas in networked communications."
0.9248,"The course will equip students with theory, methods, and techniques to investigate different design situations, develop novel design ideas, and ask critical questions about the role of technology in society.","It considers how to design networks and protocols for diverse situations, analyses several application and support protocols from a distributed systems viewpoint, and identifies significant problem areas in networked communications."
0.9221,"Characterise key aspects of human-computer interaction, such as interaction design, the user experience, and user interfaces.","This course studies the standard models for the layered approach to communication between autonomous machines in a network, and the main characteristics of data transmission across various physical link types."
0.9336,"Differentiate between design paradigms, approaches, and methods and explain their applicability to different design contexts.","It considers how to design networks and protocols for diverse situations, analyses several application and support protocols from a distributed systems viewpoint, and identifies significant problem areas in networked communications."
0.9434,"Investigate the activities and practices of a design space using design research methods, to identify opportunities and issues for design intervention.","Describe and analyse various related technical, administrative and social aspects of specific computer network protocols from standards documents and other primary materials found through research."
0.9275,"Ideate, prototype, and evaluate novel technology design ideas and their use in context.","Describe and analyse various related technical, administrative and social aspects of specific computer network protocols from standards documents and other primary materials found through research."
0.9001,"Critically reflect on the role of technology in society, including issues of power, agency, and representation in design.","It considers how to design networks and protocols for diverse situations, analyses several application and support protocols from a distributed systems viewpoint, and identifies significant problem areas in networked communications."
