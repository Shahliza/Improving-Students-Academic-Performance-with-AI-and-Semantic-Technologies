0.8826,Artificial intelligence is the science that studies and develops methods of making computers more /intelligent/.,Apply cyber security principles in a practical context.
0.9184,"The focus of this course is on core AI techniques for search, knowledge representation and reasoning, planning, and designing intelligent agents.","The course provides the essential foundations which allow students to continue in a more in-depth cyber security career, yet can also be used a standalone unit to provide a self-contained set of knowledge."
0.9203,"The course also aims to give an overview of the historical, philosophical, and logical foundations of AI.",Demonstrate a thorough understanding of the fundamental principles underlying Cyber Security.
0.8947,"Identify problems that are amenable to solution by AI methods, and which AI methods may be suited to solving a given problem.","The course provides the essential foundations which allow students to continue in a more in-depth cyber security career, yet can also be used a standalone unit to provide a self-contained set of knowledge."
0.8759,"Formalise a given problem in the language/framework of different AI methods (e.g., as a search problem, as a constraint satisfaction problem, as a planning problem, etc).","The course provides the essential foundations which allow students to continue in a more in-depth cyber security career, yet can also be used a standalone unit to provide a self-contained set of knowledge."
0.8933,"Implement basic AI algorithms (e.g., standard search or constraint propagation algorithms).","This includes principles of secure design, secrets minimization, least privilege, isolation, separation and encapsulation."
0.9130,"Design and perform an empirical evaluation of different algorithms on a problem formalisation, and state the conclusions that the evaluation supports.","The course provides the essential foundations which allow students to continue in a more in-depth cyber security career, yet can also be used a standalone unit to provide a self-contained set of knowledge."
