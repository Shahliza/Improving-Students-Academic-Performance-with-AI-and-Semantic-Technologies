0.9149,"This course takes a detailed look at the services provided by, and the internals of, an existing operating system to see how each part is constructed and integrated into the whole.","The course covers functional programming in depth, developing the core idea of functions operating on data structures."
0.9146,The lectures will also address recent literature describing advances in operating systems.,"The course also introduces imperative programming as an alternative paradigm to functional programming, highlighting similarities and contrasting differences."
0.9255,"The following topics are addressed: system programming and its facilities (including I/O, signals, job control, interprocess communication, sockets, transport layers, remote operations), system calls and their relation to the system libraries, process management and coordination, implementation of message passing, memory management, interrupt handling, real-time clocks, device-independent input/output, serial-line drivers, network communication, disk drivers, deadlock avoidance, scheduling paradigms, file systems, security.","Students learn the organization of programming languages using types, how programs are evaluated (reduction), functional composition, recursive functions, algebraic data types, pattern matching, parametric polymorphism, higher-order functions."
0.9282,"identify and evaluate features of the system library of a particular operating system, and be able to apply this knowledge to program small applications.","Describe, understand and evolve programs, via documentation, testing, and debugging."
0.9139,describe and analyse the actual algorithms and data structures that are used in a particular operating system.,"The course covers functional programming in depth, developing the core idea of functions operating on data structures."
0.9240,"define and analyse the structure of operating systems in general, especially those that support communicating processes.","The course covers functional programming in depth, developing the core idea of functions operating on data structures."
0.9310,identify and describe the reasons for many architectural features of contemporary machines.,Describe and apply alternative computational paradigms to simple problems.
0.9128,demonstrate experience in the design and implementation of a large software system.,Describe and apply alternative computational paradigms to simple problems.
