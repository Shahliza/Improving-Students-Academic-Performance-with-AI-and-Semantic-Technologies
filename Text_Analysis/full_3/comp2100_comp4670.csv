0.9090,This course provides a broad but thorough introduction to the methods and practice of statistical machine learning.,"This course continues to build on topics taught in the previous two courses. It focuses on construction of medium scale programs, using design patterns and tools that are used in the software development process."
0.9328,"Topics covered will include Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood modeling; regression, classification, density estimation, clustering, principal and independent component analysis; parametric, semi-parametric, and non-parametric models; basis functions, neural networks, kernel methods, and graphical models; deterministic and stochastic optimisation; overfitting, regularisation, and validation.","Apply basic algorithmic analysis to simple algorithms; use big-O notation formally, upper lower, and expected case bounds; use and solve recurrence relations; use appropriate algorithmic approaches to solve problems (brute-force, greedy, divide-and-conquer, recursive backtracking, heuristic, dynamic programming, branch-and-bound)."
0.9006,"Describe a number of models for supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement machine learning.","The course also covers more advanced data structures, such as priority queues, B-trees, red-black trees, and AVL trees, and deepens understanding of appropriate algorithmic strategies."
0.9005,Assess the strength and weakness of each of these models.,Apply fundamental programming concepts for medium scale programs.
0.9258,"Interpret the mathematical equations from Linear Algebra, Statistics, and Probability Theory used in these machine learning models.","Understand, apply, and analyse state and state machines in expressing computations."
0.9044,Implement efficient machine learning algorithms on a computer.,Apply fundamental programming concepts for medium scale programs.
0.9251,Design test procedures in order to evaluate a model.,Apply fundamental programming concepts for medium scale programs.
0.9065,Combine several models in order to gain better results.,Apply fundamental programming concepts for medium scale programs.
0.9211,Make choices for a model for new machine learning tasks based on reasoned argument.,"Understand, apply, and analyse state and state machines in expressing computations."
