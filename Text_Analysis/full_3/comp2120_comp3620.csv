0.8890,Artificial intelligence is the science that studies and develops methods of making computers more /intelligent/.,We will build on previous programming courses to deepen and broaden students' knowledge and understanding of the practices and tools used to build large software systems within complex environments.
0.9511,"The focus of this course is on core AI techniques for search, knowledge representation and reasoning, planning, and designing intelligent agents.","Knowledge, practices and tools considered in this course will include process models, requirements engineering, design, modelling and user experience."
0.9180,"The course also aims to give an overview of the historical, philosophical, and logical foundations of AI.",This will be achieved by introducing students to important design methodologies.
0.9157,"Identify problems that are amenable to solution by AI methods, and which AI methods may be suited to solving a given problem.","Demonstrate an ability to use professional judgement to select and apply appropriate knowledge, practices and tools to analyse, design and solve problems relating to the software engineering activities listed above."
0.8917,"Formalise a given problem in the language/framework of different AI methods (e.g., as a search problem, as a constraint satisfaction problem, as a planning problem, etc).","Demonstrate an understanding of the following key software engineering activities within the context of a realistic software engineering process (Requirements, Design, Construction, Architectures, Testing, verification and validation)"
0.9002,"Implement basic AI algorithms (e.g., standard search or constraint propagation algorithms).","We will use real-world examples such as distributed, high-integrity, web-based systems where rigorous software engineering can demonstrably enhance business value."
0.9218,"Design and perform an empirical evaluation of different algorithms on a problem formalisation, and state the conclusions that the evaluation supports.","Demonstrate an ability to use professional judgement to select and apply appropriate knowledge, practices and tools to analyse, design and solve problems relating to the software engineering activities listed above."
