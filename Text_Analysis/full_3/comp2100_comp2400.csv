0.9296,This course is an introduction to relational databases and the general skills for designing and using them.,"This course continues to build on topics taught in the previous two courses. It focuses on construction of medium scale programs, using design patterns and tools that are used in the software development process."
0.9412,"The topics include the relational data model, SQL, entity-relationship model, functional dependencies, (de-)normalisation, relational algebra, query processing and optimisation, database transactions and security.","Students will learn appropriate application of programming abstractions they have learned in previous courses to the structuring of medium scale software: inheritance, generic types, polymorphism, procedural abstraction, and abstract recursive data structures (including abstract syntax trees as a program representation, and tools that manipulate them)."
0.9361,"To deepen the understanding of relational databases, the current industry development of database systems such as NoSQL databases will be introduced at the end of this course.","This course continues to build on topics taught in the previous two courses. It focuses on construction of medium scale programs, using design patterns and tools that are used in the software development process."
0.9255,Describe the basic concepts of the relational model and understand its mathematical foundation;,Understand fundamental concepts of GUIs and user interfaces; understand the basics of modeling and simulation.
0.8389,"Use the SQL language to define, query and manipulate a relational database.","Map programming language abstractions through to execution environment; use non-source (text) internal representations of programs (e.g., abstract syntax trees); sketch low-level run-time representations of core language constructs (objects and closures)."
0.9167,Apply conceptual database modelling methods such as entity-relationship model to design a relational database.,"Students will learn appropriate application of programming abstractions they have learned in previous courses to the structuring of medium scale software: inheritance, generic types, polymorphism, procedural abstraction, and abstract recursive data structures (including abstract syntax trees as a program representation, and tools that manipulate them)."
0.9399,Apply database design methods on functional dependencies and normal forms to evaluate the quality of a relational database design.,"Students will learn appropriate application of programming abstractions they have learned in previous courses to the structuring of medium scale software: inheritance, generic types, polymorphism, procedural abstraction, and abstract recursive data structures (including abstract syntax trees as a program representation, and tools that manipulate them)."
0.9159,"Understand query processing and optimization, transaction and security management in a relational database management system.","Students will learn appropriate application of programming abstractions they have learned in previous courses to the structuring of medium scale software: inheritance, generic types, polymorphism, procedural abstraction, and abstract recursive data structures (including abstract syntax trees as a program representation, and tools that manipulate them)."
0.9184,"Understand the state of the art of database management systems, and big data management challenges (Amazon's Dynamo, Google's BigTable, MongoDB and MapReduce).","Students will learn appropriate application of programming abstractions they have learned in previous courses to the structuring of medium scale software: inheritance, generic types, polymorphism, procedural abstraction, and abstract recursive data structures (including abstract syntax trees as a program representation, and tools that manipulate them)."
