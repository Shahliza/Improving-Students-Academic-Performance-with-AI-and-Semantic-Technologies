0.9224,"Real-time and embedded systems are all around us. Controlling cars, trains, or aeroplanes, as well as mobile phones, cameras, or A/V equipment, embedded systems are a challenging and demanding part of computer science and engineering.","Massive amounts of data are being collected by public and private organisations, and research projects, while the Internet provides a very large source of information about almost every aspect of human life and society."
0.9421,This course delivers foundations of real-time analysis and implementation of systems which are interconnected with the physical world (embedded systems).,This course provides a practical focus on the technology and research in the area of data mining.
0.9226,It also delivers the principles of fault tolerant systems and highly reliable systems.,It focuses on the algorithms and techniques and less on the mathematical and statistical foundations.
