0.9274,"This course provides foundations and plenty of exercises in practical optimisation problems, while covering all basic elements of optimisation including forms of constraint programming as well as variations on linear programming and convex optimisation.","Students will learn appropriate application of programming abstractions they have learned in previous courses to the structuring of medium scale software: inheritance, generic types, polymorphism, procedural abstraction, and abstract recursive data structures (including abstract syntax trees as a program representation, and tools that manipulate them)."

0.9302,Be able to recognize and formulate convex optimization problems arising in practice.,"Understand, apply, and analyse state and state machines in expressing computations."
0.9251,Demonstrate an understanding of theoretical foundations of convex optimization and be able to use it to characterize optimal solutions to general problems.,"Understand, apply, and analyse state and state machines in expressing computations."
0.9058,Be able to define an appropriate local search neighbourhood for a given problem.,Apply fundamental programming concepts for medium scale programs.
0.9207,Be able to use a variety of meta-heuristics to escape local minima in a neighbourhood.,"The course also covers more advanced data structures, such as priority queues, B-trees, red-black trees, and AVL trees, and deepens understanding of appropriate algorithmic strategies."
