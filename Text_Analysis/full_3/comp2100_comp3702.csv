0.9474,Offensive Cyber Security operations introduces and exercises a complete range of reverse engineering techniques and attack patterns. Students will also learn and exercise analysis of systems based on minimal information.,"Describe contractual specifications, analyse documentation and specifications against other’s code, develop, understand, test, and evolve substantial programs using a modern IDE, and associated configuration tools; explain the importance of correctness for quality software; understand common coding errors and how to avoid them; practice fundamental defensive programming; understand principles of secure design."
0.9371,This is a complete course in cyber attacks which enables students on successful completion to identify and test systems for vulnerabilities without full knowledge or direct access.,"Describe contractual specifications, analyse documentation and specifications against other’s code, develop, understand, test, and evolve substantial programs using a modern IDE, and associated configuration tools; explain the importance of correctness for quality software; understand common coding errors and how to avoid them; practice fundamental defensive programming; understand principles of secure design."
0.9192,Demonstrate a thorough understanding of the fundamental principles underlying the identification and testing for vulnerabilities with limited information.,"Describe contractual specifications, analyse documentation and specifications against other’s code, develop, understand, test, and evolve substantial programs using a modern IDE, and associated configuration tools; explain the importance of correctness for quality software; understand common coding errors and how to avoid them; practice fundamental defensive programming; understand principles of secure design."
0.9237,"Analyze a system across all abstraction levels, from basic hardware to complex cloud architectures.","Students will learn appropriate application of programming abstractions they have learned in previous courses to the structuring of medium scale software: inheritance, generic types, polymorphism, procedural abstraction, and abstract recursive data structures (including abstract syntax trees as a program representation, and tools that manipulate them)."
0.9158,"Run cyber attacks, tests and probes in a practical context.","Contrast the concepts of copyright, patenting, and trademarks as mechanisms for protecting intellectual property, within the legal context for these mechanisms;  understand, analyse, and evaluate ethical/social tradeoffs in technical decisions, evaluating stakeholder positions."
0.9416,Expand conventional attack patterns to work in new system and network architectures.,Apply fundamental programming concepts for medium scale programs.
0.9080,Communicate a cyber security vulnerability and potential paths of attack to a heterogenous team of professionals.,"Describe contractual specifications, analyse documentation and specifications against other’s code, develop, understand, test, and evolve substantial programs using a modern IDE, and associated configuration tools; explain the importance of correctness for quality software; understand common coding errors and how to avoid them; practice fundamental defensive programming; understand principles of secure design."
