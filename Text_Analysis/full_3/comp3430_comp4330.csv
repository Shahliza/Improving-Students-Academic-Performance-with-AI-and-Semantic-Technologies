0.9159,"Real-time and embedded systems are all around us. Controlling cars, trains, or aeroplanes, as well as mobile phones, cameras, or A/V equipment, embedded systems are a challenging and demanding part of computer science and engineering.","This course introduces core concepts of data cleaning, standardisation, and data integration, that are aimed at converting and mapping raw data into other formats that allow more efficient and convenient use and analysis of data. The courses also discusses data quality, management, and storage issues as relevant to data analytics."
