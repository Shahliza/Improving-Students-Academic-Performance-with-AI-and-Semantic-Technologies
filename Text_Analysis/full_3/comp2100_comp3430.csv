0.8752,"Real-world data are commonly messy, distributed, and heterogeneous.","The course also covers more advanced data structures, such as priority queues, B-trees, red-black trees, and AVL trees, and deepens understanding of appropriate algorithmic strategies."
0.9478,"This course introduces core concepts of data cleaning, standardisation, and data integration, that are aimed at converting and mapping raw data into other formats that allow more efficient and convenient use and analysis of data. The courses also discusses data quality, management, and storage issues as relevant to data analytics.","Students will learn appropriate application of programming abstractions they have learned in previous courses to the structuring of medium scale software: inheritance, generic types, polymorphism, procedural abstraction, and abstract recursive data structures (including abstract syntax trees as a program representation, and tools that manipulate them)."
0.9174,"Critically reflect upon different data sources, types, formats and structures.","Contrast the concepts of copyright, patenting, and trademarks as mechanisms for protecting intellectual property, within the legal context for these mechanisms;  understand, analyse, and evaluate ethical/social tradeoffs in technical decisions, evaluating stakeholder positions."
0.9371,"Justify and apply data cleaning, preprocessing, and standardisation for data analytics.","Describe contractual specifications, analyse documentation and specifications against other’s code, develop, understand, test, and evolve substantial programs using a modern IDE, and associated configuration tools; explain the importance of correctness for quality software; understand common coding errors and how to avoid them; practice fundamental defensive programming; understand principles of secure design."
0.9211,Apply data integration concepts and techniques to heterogeneous and distributed data.,Apply fundamental programming concepts for medium scale programs.
0.9308,"Interpret, assess and discuss data quality measurements.","Understand, apply, and analyse state and state machines in expressing computations."
0.9405,"Understand and be able to use advanced data wrangling, data integration, and database techniques as relevant to data analytics.","Describe contractual specifications, analyse documentation and specifications against other’s code, develop, understand, test, and evolve substantial programs using a modern IDE, and associated configuration tools; explain the importance of correctness for quality software; understand common coding errors and how to avoid them; practice fundamental defensive programming; understand principles of secure design."
