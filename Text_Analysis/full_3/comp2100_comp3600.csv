0.9282,This course provides basic approaches for designing and analysing algorithms and data structures.,The course also treats intellectual property considerations in software development and deployment.
0.9126,It will focus on two fundamental problems in computing: Sorting and searching.,Apply fundamental programming concepts for medium scale programs.
0.9331,"It will cover various data structures and algorithm design techniques for solving these two classes of problems, as well as basic performance measures and analysis techniques for solving such problems.","Use, implement, and evaluate more advanced data structures and associated algorithms; discuss factors other than computational efficiency for evaluating software; create, implement, debug, and evaluate algorithms for solving problems, including recursively, using divide-and-conquer, and via decomposition; implement an abstract data type; analyse design and implementation alternatives."
0.9576,"Display an advanced understanding of a variety of algorithms, including linear selection, minimum spanning trees, single source shortest path, Huffman coding, etc, with real-life applications and the resource requirements.","The course also covers more advanced data structures, such as priority queues, B-trees, red-black trees, and AVL trees, and deepens understanding of appropriate algorithmic strategies."
0.9573,"Expertly apply the most effective algorithmic techniques including dynamic programming, greedy policy, and divide-and-conquer, to solve some practical problems.","Apply basic algorithmic analysis to simple algorithms; use big-O notation formally, upper lower, and expected case bounds; use and solve recurrence relations; use appropriate algorithmic approaches to solve problems (brute-force, greedy, divide-and-conquer, recursive backtracking, heuristic, dynamic programming, branch-and-bound)."
