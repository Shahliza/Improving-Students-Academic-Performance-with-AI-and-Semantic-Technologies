0.9197,This course is an introduction to relational databases and the general skills for designing and using them.,"It considers how to design networks and protocols for diverse situations, analyses several application and support protocols from a distributed systems viewpoint, and identifies significant problem areas in networked communications."
0.9308,"The topics include the relational data model, SQL, entity-relationship model, functional dependencies, (de-)normalisation, relational algebra, query processing and optimisation, database transactions and security.","Topics include: communication network architectures, signalling and modulation across physical media, real-world local and wide-area networks, internet protocol fundamentals, performance and monitoring of networks, routing, network security, and application protocols for distributed systems including web, email, video, internet-of-everything and other contemporary network topics."
0.9345,"To deepen the understanding of relational databases, the current industry development of database systems such as NoSQL databases will be introduced at the end of this course.","It considers how to design networks and protocols for diverse situations, analyses several application and support protocols from a distributed systems viewpoint, and identifies significant problem areas in networked communications."
0.9240,Describe the basic concepts of the relational model and understand its mathematical foundation;,"This course studies the standard models for the layered approach to communication between autonomous machines in a network, and the main characteristics of data transmission across various physical link types."
0.8441,"Use the SQL language to define, query and manipulate a relational database.","Describe, analyse and compare a number of datalink, network, and transport layer protocols."
0.9119,Apply conceptual database modelling methods such as entity-relationship model to design a relational database.,"It considers how to design networks and protocols for diverse situations, analyses several application and support protocols from a distributed systems viewpoint, and identifies significant problem areas in networked communications."
0.9325,Apply database design methods on functional dependencies and normal forms to evaluate the quality of a relational database design.,"It considers how to design networks and protocols for diverse situations, analyses several application and support protocols from a distributed systems viewpoint, and identifies significant problem areas in networked communications."
0.9237,"Understand query processing and optimization, transaction and security management in a relational database management system.",Program network communication services for client/server and other application layouts.
