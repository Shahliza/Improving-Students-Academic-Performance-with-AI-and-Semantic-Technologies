0.8945,This course provides basic approaches for designing and analysing algorithms and data structures.,Apply cyber security principles in a practical context.
0.8914,It will focus on two fundamental problems in computing: Sorting and searching.,Apply cyber security principles in a practical context.
0.8975,"It will cover various data structures and algorithm design techniques for solving these two classes of problems, as well as basic performance measures and analysis techniques for solving such problems.","The course provides the essential foundations which allow students to continue in a more in-depth cyber security career, yet can also be used a standalone unit to provide a self-contained set of knowledge."
0.9259,"Display an advanced understanding of a variety of algorithms, including linear selection, minimum spanning trees, single source shortest path, Huffman coding, etc, with real-life applications and the resource requirements.","This includes principles of secure design, secrets minimization, least privilege, isolation, separation and encapsulation."
0.9149,"Expertly apply the most effective algorithmic techniques including dynamic programming, greedy policy, and divide-and-conquer, to solve some practical problems.","This includes principles of secure design, secrets minimization, least privilege, isolation, separation and encapsulation."
