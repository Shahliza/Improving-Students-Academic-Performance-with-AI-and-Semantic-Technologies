0.9054,"This course takes a detailed look at the services provided by, and the internals of, an existing operating system to see how each part is constructed and integrated into the whole.","The course also aims to give an overview of the historical, philosophical, and logical foundations of AI."
0.9132,The lectures will also address recent literature describing advances in operating systems.,"The course also aims to give an overview of the historical, philosophical, and logical foundations of AI."
0.8972,"The following topics are addressed: system programming and its facilities (including I/O, signals, job control, interprocess communication, sockets, transport layers, remote operations), system calls and their relation to the system libraries, process management and coordination, implementation of message passing, memory management, interrupt handling, real-time clocks, device-independent input/output, serial-line drivers, network communication, disk drivers, deadlock avoidance, scheduling paradigms, file systems, security.","The focus of this course is on core AI techniques for search, knowledge representation and reasoning, planning, and designing intelligent agents."
0.9205,"identify and evaluate features of the system library of a particular operating system, and be able to apply this knowledge to program small applications.","Design and perform an empirical evaluation of different algorithms on a problem formalisation, and state the conclusions that the evaluation supports."
