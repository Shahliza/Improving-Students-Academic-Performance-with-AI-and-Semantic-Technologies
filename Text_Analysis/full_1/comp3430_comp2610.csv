0.8931,Information theory studies the fundamental limits of the representation and transmission of information.,Apply data integration concepts and techniques to heterogeneous and distributed data.
0.9056,"This course provides an introduction to information theory, studying fundamental concepts such as probability, information, and entropy and examining their applications in the areas of data compression, coding, communications, pattern recognition and probabilistic inference.","This course introduces core concepts of data cleaning, standardisation, and data integration, that are aimed at converting and mapping raw data into other formats that allow more efficient and convenient use and analysis of data. The courses also discusses data quality, management, and storage issues as relevant to data analytics."
