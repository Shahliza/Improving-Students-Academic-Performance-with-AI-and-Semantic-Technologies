0.8855,"This course presents some formal notations that are commonly used for the description of computation and of computing systems, for the specification of software and for mathematically rigorous arguments about program properties.","This course aims to provide students with sufficient knowledge of the basic principles of software project management that they may support a project manager to carry out the project administrative functions of a program office, understand leadership and management within the context of an agile project development team, and understand the context in which project management is conducted."
0.8877,"The following areas of study constitute the backbone of the course. Predicate calculus and natural deduction, inductive definitions of data types as a basis for recursive functions and structural induction, formal language theory (particularly regular expressions, finite state machines and context free grammars), and specification languages.","This course aims to provide students with sufficient knowledge of the basic principles of software project management that they may support a project manager to carry out the project administrative functions of a program office, understand leadership and management within the context of an agile project development team, and understand the context in which project management is conducted."
0.8929,"Apply the concepts of standard mathematical logic to produce proofs or refutations of well-formed propositions or arguments phrased in English or in a variety of formal notations (first order logic, discrete mathematics or Hoare Logic).","Employ research, critical thinking and reflection to formulate and communicate an argument concerning project management concepts."
0.8164,"Given a description of a regular language, either in English, as a regular expression or as a grammar, generate a finite state automaton that recognizes that language. Similarly, given a deterministic or nondeterministic automaton, give a description of the language which it accepts.","This course aims to provide students with sufficient knowledge of the basic principles of software project management that they may support a project manager to carry out the project administrative functions of a program office, understand leadership and management within the context of an agile project development team, and understand the context in which project management is conducted."
0.8688,"Given an inductive definition of a simple data structure, write a recursive definition of a given simple operation on data of that type. Given some such recursively defined operations, prove simple properties of these functions using the appropriate structural induction principle.",Evaluate the features of traditional and agile approaches to managing software development to decide an appropriate project management approach for a project in a business context.
0.8872,Prove simple programs correct using Hoare Logic.,"Employ research, critical thinking and reflection to formulate and communicate an argument concerning project management concepts."
0.8834,Design a Turing Machine which will accomplish simple tasks.,Many of the skills gained are of use outside formal project management environments.
