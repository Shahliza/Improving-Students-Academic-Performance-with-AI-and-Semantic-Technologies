0.9395,This course is an introduction to relational databases and the general skills for designing and using them.,"Understand the basics of event-driven programming, and its use in constructing GUIs"
0.9404,"The topics include the relational data model, SQL, entity-relationship model, functional dependencies, (de-)normalisation, relational algebra, query processing and optimisation, database transactions and security.","Distinguish language definition from implementation, syntax and parsing from semantics and evaluation, understand how program state maps to memory (globals, local, heap), and understand the implications of heap reachability for memory management."
0.9393,"To deepen the understanding of relational databases, the current industry development of database systems such as NoSQL databases will be introduced at the end of this course.","Major foci are data structures, object oriented programming, and an introduction to software engineering."
0.9256,Describe the basic concepts of the relational model and understand its mathematical foundation;,"The course includes a deeper treatment of data structures, using hash tables, trees and lists, which are used to provide concrete implementations of abstract library collection types."
0.8610,"Use the SQL language to define, query and manipulate a relational database.","Understand the basics of event-driven programming, and its use in constructing GUIs"
0.9271,Apply conceptual database modelling methods such as entity-relationship model to design a relational database.,"The course includes a deeper treatment of data structures, using hash tables, trees and lists, which are used to provide concrete implementations of abstract library collection types."
0.9388,Apply database design methods on functional dependencies and normal forms to evaluate the quality of a relational database design.,"The course includes a deeper treatment of data structures, using hash tables, trees and lists, which are used to provide concrete implementations of abstract library collection types."
0.9178,"Understand query processing and optimization, transaction and security management in a relational database management system.","Distinguish language definition from implementation, syntax and parsing from semantics and evaluation, understand how program state maps to memory (globals, local, heap), and understand the implications of heap reachability for memory management."
0.9188,"Understand the state of the art of database management systems, and big data management challenges (Amazon's Dynamo, Google's BigTable, MongoDB and MapReduce).","The foundations of software engineering including: major development paradigms (such as big plan up front, agile, and formal methods), risk are introduced."
