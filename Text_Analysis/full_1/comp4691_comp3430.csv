0.8752,"Real-world data are commonly messy, distributed, and heterogeneous.",Be able to use a variety of meta-heuristics to escape local minima in a neighbourhood.
0.9154,"This course introduces core concepts of data cleaning, standardisation, and data integration, that are aimed at converting and mapping raw data into other formats that allow more efficient and convenient use and analysis of data. The courses also discusses data quality, management, and storage issues as relevant to data analytics.","This course provides foundations and plenty of exercises in practical optimisation problems, while covering all basic elements of optimisation including forms of constraint programming as well as variations on linear programming and convex optimisation."
