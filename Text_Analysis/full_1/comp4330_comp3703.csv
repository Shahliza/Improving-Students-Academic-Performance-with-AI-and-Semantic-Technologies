0.8978,"Software Security covers advanced techniques in software vulnerability assessment, discovery and mitigation.",It also delivers the principles of fault tolerant systems and highly reliable systems.
0.9168,"These include: common patterns in software vulnerabilities, such as stack-based buffer overflow, format string vulnerabilities, and heap-based vulnerabilities; exploitation techniques such as code injection, return-oriented-programming; techniques for vulnerability discovery, such as program binaries reverse engineering, fuzzing and symbolic execution; and mitigation techniques such as memory protection mechanisms, input sanitation, and control flow integrity protection.","Techniques which are introduced include real-time calculus, real-time scheduling, elementary sensor data filtering and fusion methods, error recovery strategies, and graceful degradation methods."
0.9237,"The course features hands-on lectures and labs to analyse software vulnerabilities, both in the source code and in program binaries, and design and implement appropriate mitigation techniques.",This course delivers foundations of real-time analysis and implementation of systems which are interconnected with the physical world (embedded systems).
