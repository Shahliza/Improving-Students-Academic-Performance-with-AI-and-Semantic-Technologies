0.9451,This course is based on the foundations set by the previous course on computer organisation.,"This course continues to build on topics taught in the previous two courses. It focuses on construction of medium scale programs, using design patterns and tools that are used in the software development process."
0.9309,It expands particularly into all forms of concurrent programming including aspects of massively parallel programming.,Apply fundamental programming concepts for medium scale programs.
0.9470,"This course introduces all basic mechanisms to analyse, design, and manage concurrent, single computer-node (multicore) as well as distributed applications (e.g. as performance or dependability enhancements).","Students will learn appropriate application of programming abstractions they have learned in previous courses to the structuring of medium scale software: inheritance, generic types, polymorphism, procedural abstraction, and abstract recursive data structures (including abstract syntax trees as a program representation, and tools that manipulate them)."
0.9274,"Following on from the previous course, the fields of operating systems and networking will also be expanded on.","This course continues to build on topics taught in the previous two courses. It focuses on construction of medium scale programs, using design patterns and tools that are used in the software development process."
0.9123,"On the operating system side aspects of security, scheduling algorithms and memory management are discussed.",The course also treats intellectual property considerations in software development and deployment.
0.9330,More specific networking aspects follow on from message passing as a core concurrency construct.,"Students will learn appropriate application of programming abstractions they have learned in previous courses to the structuring of medium scale software: inheritance, generic types, polymorphism, procedural abstraction, and abstract recursive data structures (including abstract syntax trees as a program representation, and tools that manipulate them)."
