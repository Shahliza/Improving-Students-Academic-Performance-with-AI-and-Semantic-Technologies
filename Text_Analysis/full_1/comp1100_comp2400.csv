0.9349,This course is an introduction to relational databases and the general skills for designing and using them.,It introduces students to the field of computer science as a discipline for solving problems through computation and provides the foundation for more advanced courses on programming and software development.
0.9386,"The topics include the relational data model, SQL, entity-relationship model, functional dependencies, (de-)normalisation, relational algebra, query processing and optimisation, database transactions and security.","Students also gain exposure to structural induction and proof, introduction to asymptotic analysis of basic data structures, abstract data types, modules, laziness, and streams."
0.9368,"To deepen the understanding of relational databases, the current industry development of database systems such as NoSQL databases will be introduced at the end of this course.",The course also introduces students to standard productivity tools for software development that will be used throughout the course and remainder of the computer science degree.
0.9313,Describe the basic concepts of the relational model and understand its mathematical foundation;,Describe and apply alternative computational paradigms to simple problems.
0.8537,"Use the SQL language to define, query and manipulate a relational database.","Discuss, use, and apply the fundamentals of data structures, algorithms, and design; create, implement, and debug algorithms for solving simple problems, including recursively, using divide-and-conquer, and via decomposition."
0.9123,Apply conceptual database modelling methods such as entity-relationship model to design a relational database.,"Apply fundamental programming concepts, using a functional programming language, to solve simple problems."
0.9354,Apply database design methods on functional dependencies and normal forms to evaluate the quality of a relational database design.,"The course covers functional programming in depth, developing the core idea of functions operating on data structures."
0.9071,"Understand query processing and optimization, transaction and security management in a relational database management system.","Students also gain exposure to structural induction and proof, introduction to asymptotic analysis of basic data structures, abstract data types, modules, laziness, and streams."
0.9018,"Understand the state of the art of database management systems, and big data management challenges (Amazon's Dynamo, Google's BigTable, MongoDB and MapReduce).","Students also gain exposure to structural induction and proof, introduction to asymptotic analysis of basic data structures, abstract data types, modules, laziness, and streams."
