0.8888,"Real-world data are commonly messy, distributed, and heterogeneous.","Construct and manipulate complex models, geometries and scene graphs in both 2D and 3D"
0.9352,"This course introduces core concepts of data cleaning, standardisation, and data integration, that are aimed at converting and mapping raw data into other formats that allow more efficient and convenient use and analysis of data. The courses also discusses data quality, management, and storage issues as relevant to data analytics.","These key concepts in computer graphics programming will be covered from their mathematical foundations through to their application in domains such as data visualisation, virtual reality, computer games and film animation/VFX."
0.9068,"Critically reflect upon different data sources, types, formats and structures.","Construct and manipulate complex models, geometries and scene graphs in both 2D and 3D"
0.8986,"Justify and apply data cleaning, preprocessing, and standardisation for data analytics.",In this course students will explore these concepts through practical implementation in a modern computer graphics software context.
0.9144,Apply data integration concepts and techniques to heterogeneous and distributed data.,"Construct and manipulate complex models, geometries and scene graphs in both 2D and 3D"
