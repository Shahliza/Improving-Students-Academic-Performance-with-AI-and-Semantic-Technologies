0.9126,"Software Security covers advanced techniques in software vulnerability assessment, discovery and mitigation.","Select appropriate modeling techniques, tools and mechanisms to solve a range of problems in concurrent and distributed systems."
0.9214,"These include: common patterns in software vulnerabilities, such as stack-based buffer overflow, format string vulnerabilities, and heap-based vulnerabilities; exploitation techniques such as code injection, return-oriented-programming; techniques for vulnerability discovery, such as program binaries reverse engineering, fuzzing and symbolic execution; and mitigation techniques such as memory protection mechanisms, input sanitation, and control flow integrity protection.","This course introduces all basic mechanisms to analyse, design, and manage concurrent, single computer-node (multicore) as well as distributed applications (e.g. as performance or dependability enhancements)."
