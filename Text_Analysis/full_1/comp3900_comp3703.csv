0.8886,"Software Security covers advanced techniques in software vulnerability assessment, discovery and mitigation.","Investigate the activities and practices of a design space using design research methods, to identify opportunities and issues for design intervention."
0.8651,"These include: common patterns in software vulnerabilities, such as stack-based buffer overflow, format string vulnerabilities, and heap-based vulnerabilities; exploitation techniques such as code injection, return-oriented-programming; techniques for vulnerability discovery, such as program binaries reverse engineering, fuzzing and symbolic execution; and mitigation techniques such as memory protection mechanisms, input sanitation, and control flow integrity protection.","Investigate the activities and practices of a design space using design research methods, to identify opportunities and issues for design intervention."
0.9305,"The course features hands-on lectures and labs to analyse software vulnerabilities, both in the source code and in program binaries, and design and implement appropriate mitigation techniques.","The course will equip students with theory, methods, and techniques to investigate different design situations, develop novel design ideas, and ask critical questions about the role of technology in society."
