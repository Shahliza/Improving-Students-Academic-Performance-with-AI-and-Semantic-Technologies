0.9266,The course introduces students to some fundamentals of research methodology.,This course provides a broad but thorough introduction to the methods and practice of statistical machine learning.
0.9050,"The course comprises a series of lectures which cover the following topics: Philosophy of Science, Quantitative Research Methods, Qualitative Research Methods, Basic Machine Learning Methods, Theoretical Research Methods, How to find a Research Topic, Literature Analysis, Reading and Reviewing Papers, Research Ethics and Commercialising Research.","Topics covered will include Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood modeling; regression, classification, density estimation, clustering, principal and independent component analysis; parametric, semi-parametric, and non-parametric models; basis functions, neural networks, kernel methods, and graphical models; deterministic and stochastic optimisation; overfitting, regularisation, and validation."
0.8963,"The lectures will be complemented by a series of workshops, labs and assignments that require students to do some small research focused tasks that help them get a hands-on experience of research, both individually and in teams of students.",Combine several models in order to gain better results.
0.9269,"This includes different tasks such as topic modelling, statistical analysis, applying different machine learning techniques to solve a problem in a team, proving theorems, complexity analysis, designing a research project, reviewing papers and presenting papers.","Interpret the mathematical equations from Linear Algebra, Statistics, and Probability Theory used in these machine learning models."
