0.8914,"This course presents some formal notations that are commonly used for the description of computation and of computing systems, for the specification of software and for mathematically rigorous arguments about program properties.","Differentiate between design paradigms, approaches, and methods and explain their applicability to different design contexts."
0.8790,"The following areas of study constitute the backbone of the course. Predicate calculus and natural deduction, inductive definitions of data types as a basis for recursive functions and structural induction, formal language theory (particularly regular expressions, finite state machines and context free grammars), and specification languages.","The course will equip students with theory, methods, and techniques to investigate different design situations, develop novel design ideas, and ask critical questions about the role of technology in society."
0.8898,"Apply the concepts of standard mathematical logic to produce proofs or refutations of well-formed propositions or arguments phrased in English or in a variety of formal notations (first order logic, discrete mathematics or Hoare Logic).","Differentiate between design paradigms, approaches, and methods and explain their applicability to different design contexts."
0.8031,"Given a description of a regular language, either in English, as a regular expression or as a grammar, generate a finite state automaton that recognizes that language. Similarly, given a deterministic or nondeterministic automaton, give a description of the language which it accepts.","Characterise key aspects of human-computer interaction, such as interaction design, the user experience, and user interfaces."
0.8601,"Given an inductive definition of a simple data structure, write a recursive definition of a given simple operation on data of that type. Given some such recursively defined operations, prove simple properties of these functions using the appropriate structural induction principle.","Differentiate between design paradigms, approaches, and methods and explain their applicability to different design contexts."
0.8731,Prove simple programs correct using Hoare Logic.,"Ideate, prototype, and evaluate novel technology design ideas and their use in context."
0.8714,Design a Turing Machine which will accomplish simple tasks.,"Characterise key aspects of human-computer interaction, such as interaction design, the user experience, and user interfaces."
