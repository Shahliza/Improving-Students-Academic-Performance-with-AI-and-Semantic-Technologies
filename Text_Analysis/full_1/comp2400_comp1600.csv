0.9133,"This course presents some formal notations that are commonly used for the description of computation and of computing systems, for the specification of software and for mathematically rigorous arguments about program properties.",This course is an introduction to relational databases and the general skills for designing and using them.
0.9243,"The following areas of study constitute the backbone of the course. Predicate calculus and natural deduction, inductive definitions of data types as a basis for recursive functions and structural induction, formal language theory (particularly regular expressions, finite state machines and context free grammars), and specification languages.","The topics include the relational data model, SQL, entity-relationship model, functional dependencies, (de-)normalisation, relational algebra, query processing and optimisation, database transactions and security."
0.9030,"Apply the concepts of standard mathematical logic to produce proofs or refutations of well-formed propositions or arguments phrased in English or in a variety of formal notations (first order logic, discrete mathematics or Hoare Logic).",Describe the basic concepts of the relational model and understand its mathematical foundation;
0.8516,"Given a description of a regular language, either in English, as a regular expression or as a grammar, generate a finite state automaton that recognizes that language. Similarly, given a deterministic or nondeterministic automaton, give a description of the language which it accepts.",Apply conceptual database modelling methods such as entity-relationship model to design a relational database.
0.9109,"Given an inductive definition of a simple data structure, write a recursive definition of a given simple operation on data of that type. Given some such recursively defined operations, prove simple properties of these functions using the appropriate structural induction principle.",Apply database design methods on functional dependencies and normal forms to evaluate the quality of a relational database design.
0.9181,Prove simple programs correct using Hoare Logic.,Apply database design methods on functional dependencies and normal forms to evaluate the quality of a relational database design.
0.8955,Design a Turing Machine which will accomplish simple tasks.,Apply database design methods on functional dependencies and normal forms to evaluate the quality of a relational database design.
