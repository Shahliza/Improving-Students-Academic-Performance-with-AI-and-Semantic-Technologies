0.9036,"This course presents some formal notations that are commonly used for the description of computation and of computing systems, for the specification of software and for mathematically rigorous arguments about program properties.",Explain the relationship between rules of deduction and the semantics of logic.
0.9395,"The following areas of study constitute the backbone of the course. Predicate calculus and natural deduction, inductive definitions of data types as a basis for recursive functions and structural induction, formal language theory (particularly regular expressions, finite state machines and context free grammars), and specification languages.",Construct natural deduction proofs in first order logic and translate between calculi.
0.9500,"Apply the concepts of standard mathematical logic to produce proofs or refutations of well-formed propositions or arguments phrased in English or in a variety of formal notations (first order logic, discrete mathematics or Hoare Logic).",Construct natural deduction proofs in first order logic and translate between calculi.
0.8759,"Given a description of a regular language, either in English, as a regular expression or as a grammar, generate a finite state automaton that recognizes that language. Similarly, given a deterministic or nondeterministic automaton, give a description of the language which it accepts.",Construct natural deduction proofs in first order logic and translate between calculi.
0.9185,"Given an inductive definition of a simple data structure, write a recursive definition of a given simple operation on data of that type. Given some such recursively defined operations, prove simple properties of these functions using the appropriate structural induction principle.",Construct natural deduction proofs in first order logic and translate between calculi.
0.9457,Prove simple programs correct using Hoare Logic.,Construct natural deduction proofs in first order logic and translate between calculi.
0.9055,Design a Turing Machine which will accomplish simple tasks.,Express reasoning problems using first order logical notation.
