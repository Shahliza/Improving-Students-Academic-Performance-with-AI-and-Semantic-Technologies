0.9255,Cyber Security Foundations introduces all essential cyber security principles.,The course also treats intellectual property considerations in software development and deployment.
0.9198,"This includes principles of secure design, secrets minimization, least privilege, isolation, separation and encapsulation.","The course also covers more advanced data structures, such as priority queues, B-trees, red-black trees, and AVL trees, and deepens understanding of appropriate algorithmic strategies."
0.9246,The interplay between failed security principles and vulnerabilities is investigated in detail.,"Contrast the concepts of copyright, patenting, and trademarks as mechanisms for protecting intellectual property, within the legal context for these mechanisms;  understand, analyse, and evaluate ethical/social tradeoffs in technical decisions, evaluating stakeholder positions."
0.9325,"The course provides the essential foundations which allow students to continue in a more in-depth cyber security career, yet can also be used a standalone unit to provide a self-contained set of knowledge.","This course continues to build on topics taught in the previous two courses. It focuses on construction of medium scale programs, using design patterns and tools that are used in the software development process."
