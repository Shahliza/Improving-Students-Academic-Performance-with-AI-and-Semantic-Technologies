0.9231,This course is an introduction to relational databases and the general skills for designing and using them.,demonstrate a basic knowledge of numerical computing using an appropriate programming language.
0.9290,"The topics include the relational data model, SQL, entity-relationship model, functional dependencies, (de-)normalisation, relational algebra, query processing and optimisation, database transactions and security.","The following topics will be addressed: the C++ programming language; basic numerical computing from aspects of floating point error analysis to algorithms for solving differential equations; the engineering of scientific software; general high performance computing concepts and architectural principles; modern scalar architectures and their memory structure; performance and programmability issues, and program analysis techniques for high performance computing; parallel computing paradigms and programming using the OpenMP standard; trends in HPC systems."
0.9322,"To deepen the understanding of relational databases, the current industry development of database systems such as NoSQL databases will be introduced at the end of this course.","The focus will be on the C and C++ programming languages, although reflecting the reality of modern scientific computation this course will also touch on other languages such as Python, Java and FORTRAN95."
0.9079,Describe the basic concepts of the relational model and understand its mathematical foundation;,be able to reason about the accuracy of mathematical and numerical models of real physical phenomena.
0.8350,"Use the SQL language to define, query and manipulate a relational database.","The course will study high performance computer architectures, including modern parallel processors, and will describe how an algorithm interacts with these architectures."
0.8960,Apply conceptual database modelling methods such as entity-relationship model to design a relational database.,It will also look at practical methods of estimating and measuring algorithm/architecture performance.
0.9176,Apply database design methods on functional dependencies and normal forms to evaluate the quality of a relational database design.,be competent in experimental computing in a numerical context and of the optimisation of algorithms on high performance architectures.
0.9062,"Understand query processing and optimization, transaction and security management in a relational database management system.","The following topics will be addressed: the C++ programming language; basic numerical computing from aspects of floating point error analysis to algorithms for solving differential equations; the engineering of scientific software; general high performance computing concepts and architectural principles; modern scalar architectures and their memory structure; performance and programmability issues, and program analysis techniques for high performance computing; parallel computing paradigms and programming using the OpenMP standard; trends in HPC systems."
