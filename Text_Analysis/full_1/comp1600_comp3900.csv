0.8826,"This course will provide an introduction to the field of Human-Computer Interaction and will introduce students to key interaction and experience design paradigms, approaches and methods.","This course presents some formal notations that are commonly used for the description of computation and of computing systems, for the specification of software and for mathematically rigorous arguments about program properties."
0.8790,"The course will equip students with theory, methods, and techniques to investigate different design situations, develop novel design ideas, and ask critical questions about the role of technology in society.","The following areas of study constitute the backbone of the course. Predicate calculus and natural deduction, inductive definitions of data types as a basis for recursive functions and structural induction, formal language theory (particularly regular expressions, finite state machines and context free grammars), and specification languages."
0.8856,"Characterise key aspects of human-computer interaction, such as interaction design, the user experience, and user interfaces.","This course presents some formal notations that are commonly used for the description of computation and of computing systems, for the specification of software and for mathematically rigorous arguments about program properties."
0.8914,"Differentiate between design paradigms, approaches, and methods and explain their applicability to different design contexts.","This course presents some formal notations that are commonly used for the description of computation and of computing systems, for the specification of software and for mathematically rigorous arguments about program properties."
0.8695,"Investigate the activities and practices of a design space using design research methods, to identify opportunities and issues for design intervention.",Prove simple programs correct using Hoare Logic.
0.8731,"Ideate, prototype, and evaluate novel technology design ideas and their use in context.",Prove simple programs correct using Hoare Logic.
0.8533,"Critically reflect on the role of technology in society, including issues of power, agency, and representation in design.","The following areas of study constitute the backbone of the course. Predicate calculus and natural deduction, inductive definitions of data types as a basis for recursive functions and structural induction, formal language theory (particularly regular expressions, finite state machines and context free grammars), and specification languages."
