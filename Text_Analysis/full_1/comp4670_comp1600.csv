0.8992,"This course presents some formal notations that are commonly used for the description of computation and of computing systems, for the specification of software and for mathematically rigorous arguments about program properties.","Interpret the mathematical equations from Linear Algebra, Statistics, and Probability Theory used in these machine learning models."
0.9234,"The following areas of study constitute the backbone of the course. Predicate calculus and natural deduction, inductive definitions of data types as a basis for recursive functions and structural induction, formal language theory (particularly regular expressions, finite state machines and context free grammars), and specification languages.","Interpret the mathematical equations from Linear Algebra, Statistics, and Probability Theory used in these machine learning models."
0.9213,"Apply the concepts of standard mathematical logic to produce proofs or refutations of well-formed propositions or arguments phrased in English or in a variety of formal notations (first order logic, discrete mathematics or Hoare Logic).","Interpret the mathematical equations from Linear Algebra, Statistics, and Probability Theory used in these machine learning models."
0.8637,"Given a description of a regular language, either in English, as a regular expression or as a grammar, generate a finite state automaton that recognizes that language. Similarly, given a deterministic or nondeterministic automaton, give a description of the language which it accepts.","Interpret the mathematical equations from Linear Algebra, Statistics, and Probability Theory used in these machine learning models."
0.9040,"Given an inductive definition of a simple data structure, write a recursive definition of a given simple operation on data of that type. Given some such recursively defined operations, prove simple properties of these functions using the appropriate structural induction principle.",Make choices for a model for new machine learning tasks based on reasoned argument.
