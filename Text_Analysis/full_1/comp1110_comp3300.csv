0.9081,"This course takes a detailed look at the services provided by, and the internals of, an existing operating system to see how each part is constructed and integrated into the whole.","Understand the basics of event-driven programming, and its use in constructing GUIs"
0.9169,The lectures will also address recent literature describing advances in operating systems.,"Major foci are data structures, object oriented programming, and an introduction to software engineering."
0.9379,"The following topics are addressed: system programming and its facilities (including I/O, signals, job control, interprocess communication, sockets, transport layers, remote operations), system calls and their relation to the system libraries, process management and coordination, implementation of message passing, memory management, interrupt handling, real-time clocks, device-independent input/output, serial-line drivers, network communication, disk drivers, deadlock avoidance, scheduling paradigms, file systems, security.","Distinguish language definition from implementation, syntax and parsing from semantics and evaluation, understand how program state maps to memory (globals, local, heap), and understand the implications of heap reachability for memory management."
0.9435,"identify and evaluate features of the system library of a particular operating system, and be able to apply this knowledge to program small applications.","Develop, understand, test, and evolve substantial programs using a modern IDE, and associated configuration tools; understand common coding errors and how to avoid them; practice fundamental defensive programming; perform individual and team program reviews; use established design principles to organize a software system."
0.9227,describe and analyse the actual algorithms and data structures that are used in a particular operating system.,"The course includes a deeper treatment of data structures, using hash tables, trees and lists, which are used to provide concrete implementations of abstract library collection types."
0.9298,"define and analyse the structure of operating systems in general, especially those that support communicating processes.","Understand the basics of event-driven programming, and its use in constructing GUIs"
0.9118,identify and describe the reasons for many architectural features of contemporary machines.,"Deliver and evaluate basic technical documents, presentations, and group interactions, using appropriate tools."
0.9260,demonstrate experience in the design and implementation of a large software system.,This course introduces students to the fundamentals of software development with a substantial group software project at its center.
