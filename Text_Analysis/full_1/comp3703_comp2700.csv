0.9121,Cyber Security Foundations introduces all essential cyber security principles.,Demonstrate a thorough understanding in exploitation techniques against software vulnerabilities and defensive techniques against these exploitations.
0.9137,"This includes principles of secure design, secrets minimization, least privilege, isolation, separation and encapsulation.","These include: common patterns in software vulnerabilities, such as stack-based buffer overflow, format string vulnerabilities, and heap-based vulnerabilities; exploitation techniques such as code injection, return-oriented-programming; techniques for vulnerability discovery, such as program binaries reverse engineering, fuzzing and symbolic execution; and mitigation techniques such as memory protection mechanisms, input sanitation, and control flow integrity protection."
0.9422,The interplay between failed security principles and vulnerabilities is investigated in detail.,Demonstrate a thorough understanding in exploitation techniques against software vulnerabilities and defensive techniques against these exploitations.
0.9147,"The course provides the essential foundations which allow students to continue in a more in-depth cyber security career, yet can also be used a standalone unit to provide a self-contained set of knowledge.","The course features hands-on lectures and labs to analyse software vulnerabilities, both in the source code and in program binaries, and design and implement appropriate mitigation techniques."
