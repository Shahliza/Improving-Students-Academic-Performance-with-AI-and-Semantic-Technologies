0.9097,"This course presents some formal notations that are commonly used for the description of computation and of computing systems, for the specification of software and for mathematically rigorous arguments about program properties.","These key concepts in computer graphics programming will be covered from their mathematical foundations through to their application in domains such as data visualisation, virtual reality, computer games and film animation/VFX."
0.9067,"The following areas of study constitute the backbone of the course. Predicate calculus and natural deduction, inductive definitions of data types as a basis for recursive functions and structural induction, formal language theory (particularly regular expressions, finite state machines and context free grammars), and specification languages.","These key concepts in computer graphics programming will be covered from their mathematical foundations through to their application in domains such as data visualisation, virtual reality, computer games and film animation/VFX."
0.8985,"Apply the concepts of standard mathematical logic to produce proofs or refutations of well-formed propositions or arguments phrased in English or in a variety of formal notations (first order logic, discrete mathematics or Hoare Logic).","These key concepts in computer graphics programming will be covered from their mathematical foundations through to their application in domains such as data visualisation, virtual reality, computer games and film animation/VFX."
0.8570,"Given a description of a regular language, either in English, as a regular expression or as a grammar, generate a finite state automaton that recognizes that language. Similarly, given a deterministic or nondeterministic automaton, give a description of the language which it accepts.",Implement computer graphics algorithms in a shader language
0.8743,"Given an inductive definition of a simple data structure, write a recursive definition of a given simple operation on data of that type. Given some such recursively defined operations, prove simple properties of these functions using the appropriate structural induction principle.","In this course students will learn about fundamental algorithms, data structures and programming models used in 3D graphics applications."
0.8943,Prove simple programs correct using Hoare Logic.,In this course students will explore these concepts through practical implementation in a modern computer graphics software context.
0.9078,Design a Turing Machine which will accomplish simple tasks.,"In this course students will learn about fundamental algorithms, data structures and programming models used in 3D graphics applications."
