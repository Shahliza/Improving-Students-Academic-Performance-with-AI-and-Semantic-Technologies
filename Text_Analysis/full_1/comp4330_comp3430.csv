0.8972,"Real-world data are commonly messy, distributed, and heterogeneous.","Real-time and embedded systems are all around us. Controlling cars, trains, or aeroplanes, as well as mobile phones, cameras, or A/V equipment, embedded systems are a challenging and demanding part of computer science and engineering."
0.9420,"This course introduces core concepts of data cleaning, standardisation, and data integration, that are aimed at converting and mapping raw data into other formats that allow more efficient and convenient use and analysis of data. The courses also discusses data quality, management, and storage issues as relevant to data analytics.","Techniques which are introduced include real-time calculus, real-time scheduling, elementary sensor data filtering and fusion methods, error recovery strategies, and graceful degradation methods."
0.9120,"Critically reflect upon different data sources, types, formats and structures.","Techniques which are introduced include real-time calculus, real-time scheduling, elementary sensor data filtering and fusion methods, error recovery strategies, and graceful degradation methods."
0.9448,"Justify and apply data cleaning, preprocessing, and standardisation for data analytics.","Techniques which are introduced include real-time calculus, real-time scheduling, elementary sensor data filtering and fusion methods, error recovery strategies, and graceful degradation methods."
0.9306,Apply data integration concepts and techniques to heterogeneous and distributed data.,This course delivers foundations of real-time analysis and implementation of systems which are interconnected with the physical world (embedded systems).
0.9201,"Interpret, assess and discuss data quality measurements.",Understand and consider constraints from physical dynamical systems.
0.9405,"Understand and be able to use advanced data wrangling, data integration, and database techniques as relevant to data analytics.","Techniques which are introduced include real-time calculus, real-time scheduling, elementary sensor data filtering and fusion methods, error recovery strategies, and graceful degradation methods."
