0.8936,"Software Security covers advanced techniques in software vulnerability assessment, discovery and mitigation.","Demonstrate knowledge of accessibility, compliance with standards, privacy concerns and personalisation for web sites."
0.9085,"These include: common patterns in software vulnerabilities, such as stack-based buffer overflow, format string vulnerabilities, and heap-based vulnerabilities; exploitation techniques such as code injection, return-oriented-programming; techniques for vulnerability discovery, such as program binaries reverse engineering, fuzzing and symbolic execution; and mitigation techniques such as memory protection mechanisms, input sanitation, and control flow integrity protection.","Topics such as the nature and types of multimedia objects, components of a multimedia system, Web authoring, delivery tools, multimedia applications, spam, podcasts, RSS, web spam and societal implications of the web. Students will create multimedia applications using some or all of HTML, XHTML, JavaScript, animation, sound, video and 3D."
0.9314,"The course features hands-on lectures and labs to analyse software vulnerabilities, both in the source code and in program binaries, and design and implement appropriate mitigation techniques.","Understand and be able to develop and design web sites including multimedia content by applying current web design principles, guidelines and heuristics."
