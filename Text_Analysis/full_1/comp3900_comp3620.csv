0.8955,Artificial intelligence is the science that studies and develops methods of making computers more /intelligent/.,"Characterise key aspects of human-computer interaction, such as interaction design, the user experience, and user interfaces."
0.9363,"The focus of this course is on core AI techniques for search, knowledge representation and reasoning, planning, and designing intelligent agents.","The course will equip students with theory, methods, and techniques to investigate different design situations, develop novel design ideas, and ask critical questions about the role of technology in society."
0.9249,"The course also aims to give an overview of the historical, philosophical, and logical foundations of AI.","The course will equip students with theory, methods, and techniques to investigate different design situations, develop novel design ideas, and ask critical questions about the role of technology in society."
0.9136,"Identify problems that are amenable to solution by AI methods, and which AI methods may be suited to solving a given problem.","Differentiate between design paradigms, approaches, and methods and explain their applicability to different design contexts."
0.8893,"Formalise a given problem in the language/framework of different AI methods (e.g., as a search problem, as a constraint satisfaction problem, as a planning problem, etc).","Differentiate between design paradigms, approaches, and methods and explain their applicability to different design contexts."
0.8844,"Implement basic AI algorithms (e.g., standard search or constraint propagation algorithms).","Investigate the activities and practices of a design space using design research methods, to identify opportunities and issues for design intervention."
0.9347,"Design and perform an empirical evaluation of different algorithms on a problem formalisation, and state the conclusions that the evaluation supports.","Investigate the activities and practices of a design space using design research methods, to identify opportunities and issues for design intervention."
