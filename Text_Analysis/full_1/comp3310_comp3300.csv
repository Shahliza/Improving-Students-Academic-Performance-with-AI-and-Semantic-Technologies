0.9204,"This course takes a detailed look at the services provided by, and the internals of, an existing operating system to see how each part is constructed and integrated into the whole.","It considers how to design networks and protocols for diverse situations, analyses several application and support protocols from a distributed systems viewpoint, and identifies significant problem areas in networked communications."
0.9218,The lectures will also address recent literature describing advances in operating systems.,"Describe and analyse various related technical, administrative and social aspects of specific computer network protocols from standards documents and other primary materials found through research."
0.9529,"The following topics are addressed: system programming and its facilities (including I/O, signals, job control, interprocess communication, sockets, transport layers, remote operations), system calls and their relation to the system libraries, process management and coordination, implementation of message passing, memory management, interrupt handling, real-time clocks, device-independent input/output, serial-line drivers, network communication, disk drivers, deadlock avoidance, scheduling paradigms, file systems, security.","Topics include: communication network architectures, signalling and modulation across physical media, real-world local and wide-area networks, internet protocol fundamentals, performance and monitoring of networks, routing, network security, and application protocols for distributed systems including web, email, video, internet-of-everything and other contemporary network topics."
0.9337,"identify and evaluate features of the system library of a particular operating system, and be able to apply this knowledge to program small applications.","It considers how to design networks and protocols for diverse situations, analyses several application and support protocols from a distributed systems viewpoint, and identifies significant problem areas in networked communications."
0.9192,describe and analyse the actual algorithms and data structures that are used in a particular operating system.,"It considers how to design networks and protocols for diverse situations, analyses several application and support protocols from a distributed systems viewpoint, and identifies significant problem areas in networked communications."
