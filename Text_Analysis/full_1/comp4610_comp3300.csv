0.9004,"This course takes a detailed look at the services provided by, and the internals of, an existing operating system to see how each part is constructed and integrated into the whole.","In this course students will learn about fundamental algorithms, data structures and programming models used in 3D graphics applications."
0.9193,The lectures will also address recent literature describing advances in operating systems.,In this course students will explore these concepts through practical implementation in a modern computer graphics software context.
0.8968,"The following topics are addressed: system programming and its facilities (including I/O, signals, job control, interprocess communication, sockets, transport layers, remote operations), system calls and their relation to the system libraries, process management and coordination, implementation of message passing, memory management, interrupt handling, real-time clocks, device-independent input/output, serial-line drivers, network communication, disk drivers, deadlock avoidance, scheduling paradigms, file systems, security.","These key concepts in computer graphics programming will be covered from their mathematical foundations through to their application in domains such as data visualisation, virtual reality, computer games and film animation/VFX."
0.9198,"identify and evaluate features of the system library of a particular operating system, and be able to apply this knowledge to program small applications.","In this course students will learn about fundamental algorithms, data structures and programming models used in 3D graphics applications."
0.9182,describe and analyse the actual algorithms and data structures that are used in a particular operating system.,"In this course students will learn about fundamental algorithms, data structures and programming models used in 3D graphics applications."
