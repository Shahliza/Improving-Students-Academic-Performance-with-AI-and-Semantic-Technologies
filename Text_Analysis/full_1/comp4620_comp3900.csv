0.9178,"This course will provide an introduction to the field of Human-Computer Interaction and will introduce students to key interaction and experience design paradigms, approaches and methods.","This is an advanced undergraduate course that covers advanced topics in Artificial Intelligence. Topics vary from one offering to the next and are likely to be drawn from the following list: planning, scheduling, games, search, reasoning (constraint-based, model-based, spatial, temporal), knowledge representation, decision-making under uncertainty, reinforcement learning, agents, foundations."
0.9237,"The course will equip students with theory, methods, and techniques to investigate different design situations, develop novel design ideas, and ask critical questions about the role of technology in society.","Improve their skills at navigating through, and critically examining, the scientific literature on the taught topic(s)."
