0.8997,"This course takes a detailed look at the services provided by, and the internals of, an existing operating system to see how each part is constructed and integrated into the whole.","The course provides the essential foundations which allow students to continue in a more in-depth cyber security career, yet can also be used a standalone unit to provide a self-contained set of knowledge."
0.9022,The lectures will also address recent literature describing advances in operating systems.,Cyber Security Foundations introduces all essential cyber security principles.
0.9068,"The following topics are addressed: system programming and its facilities (including I/O, signals, job control, interprocess communication, sockets, transport layers, remote operations), system calls and their relation to the system libraries, process management and coordination, implementation of message passing, memory management, interrupt handling, real-time clocks, device-independent input/output, serial-line drivers, network communication, disk drivers, deadlock avoidance, scheduling paradigms, file systems, security.","This includes principles of secure design, secrets minimization, least privilege, isolation, separation and encapsulation."
0.9014,"identify and evaluate features of the system library of a particular operating system, and be able to apply this knowledge to program small applications.","The course provides the essential foundations which allow students to continue in a more in-depth cyber security career, yet can also be used a standalone unit to provide a self-contained set of knowledge."
