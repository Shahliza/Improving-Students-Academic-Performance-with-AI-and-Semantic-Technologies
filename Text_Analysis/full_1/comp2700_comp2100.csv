0.9325,"This course continues to build on topics taught in the previous two courses. It focuses on construction of medium scale programs, using design patterns and tools that are used in the software development process.","The course provides the essential foundations which allow students to continue in a more in-depth cyber security career, yet can also be used a standalone unit to provide a self-contained set of knowledge."
0.9153,Students will gain further experience with industry standard revision control and integrated development environment (IDE) tools.,"The course provides the essential foundations which allow students to continue in a more in-depth cyber security career, yet can also be used a standalone unit to provide a self-contained set of knowledge."
0.9233,"Students will learn appropriate application of programming abstractions they have learned in previous courses to the structuring of medium scale software: inheritance, generic types, polymorphism, procedural abstraction, and abstract recursive data structures (including abstract syntax trees as a program representation, and tools that manipulate them).","The course provides the essential foundations which allow students to continue in a more in-depth cyber security career, yet can also be used a standalone unit to provide a self-contained set of knowledge."
0.9198,"The course also covers more advanced data structures, such as priority queues, B-trees, red-black trees, and AVL trees, and deepens understanding of appropriate algorithmic strategies.","This includes principles of secure design, secrets minimization, least privilege, isolation, separation and encapsulation."
