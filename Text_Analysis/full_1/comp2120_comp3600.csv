0.9271,This course provides basic approaches for designing and analysing algorithms and data structures.,We will build on previous programming courses to deepen and broaden students' knowledge and understanding of the practices and tools used to build large software systems within complex environments.
0.9032,It will focus on two fundamental problems in computing: Sorting and searching.,This will be achieved by introducing students to important design methodologies.
0.9233,"It will cover various data structures and algorithm design techniques for solving these two classes of problems, as well as basic performance measures and analysis techniques for solving such problems.","Knowledge, practices and tools considered in this course will include process models, requirements engineering, design, modelling and user experience."
0.9264,"Display an advanced understanding of a variety of algorithms, including linear selection, minimum spanning trees, single source shortest path, Huffman coding, etc, with real-life applications and the resource requirements.","We will use real-world examples such as distributed, high-integrity, web-based systems where rigorous software engineering can demonstrably enhance business value."
0.9191,"Expertly apply the most effective algorithmic techniques including dynamic programming, greedy policy, and divide-and-conquer, to solve some practical problems.","We will use real-world examples such as distributed, high-integrity, web-based systems where rigorous software engineering can demonstrably enhance business value."
