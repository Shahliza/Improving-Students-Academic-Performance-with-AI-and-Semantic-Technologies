0.9348,"This course will provide an introduction to the field of Human-Computer Interaction and will introduce students to key interaction and experience design paradigms, approaches and methods.","This course continues to build on topics taught in the previous two courses. It focuses on construction of medium scale programs, using design patterns and tools that are used in the software development process."
0.9399,"The course will equip students with theory, methods, and techniques to investigate different design situations, develop novel design ideas, and ask critical questions about the role of technology in society.","This course continues to build on topics taught in the previous two courses. It focuses on construction of medium scale programs, using design patterns and tools that are used in the software development process."
0.9308,"Characterise key aspects of human-computer interaction, such as interaction design, the user experience, and user interfaces.",Understand fundamental concepts of GUIs and user interfaces; understand the basics of modeling and simulation.
0.9282,"Differentiate between design paradigms, approaches, and methods and explain their applicability to different design contexts.","Contrast the concepts of copyright, patenting, and trademarks as mechanisms for protecting intellectual property, within the legal context for these mechanisms;  understand, analyse, and evaluate ethical/social tradeoffs in technical decisions, evaluating stakeholder positions."
0.9456,"Investigate the activities and practices of a design space using design research methods, to identify opportunities and issues for design intervention.","Contrast the concepts of copyright, patenting, and trademarks as mechanisms for protecting intellectual property, within the legal context for these mechanisms;  understand, analyse, and evaluate ethical/social tradeoffs in technical decisions, evaluating stakeholder positions."
0.9305,"Ideate, prototype, and evaluate novel technology design ideas and their use in context.","Describe contractual specifications, analyse documentation and specifications against otherâ€™s code, develop, understand, test, and evolve substantial programs using a modern IDE, and associated configuration tools; explain the importance of correctness for quality software; understand common coding errors and how to avoid them; practice fundamental defensive programming; understand principles of secure design."
0.9182,"Critically reflect on the role of technology in society, including issues of power, agency, and representation in design.","Contrast the concepts of copyright, patenting, and trademarks as mechanisms for protecting intellectual property, within the legal context for these mechanisms;  understand, analyse, and evaluate ethical/social tradeoffs in technical decisions, evaluating stakeholder positions."
