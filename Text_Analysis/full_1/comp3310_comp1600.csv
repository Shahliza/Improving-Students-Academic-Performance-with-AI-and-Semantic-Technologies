0.9197,"This course presents some formal notations that are commonly used for the description of computation and of computing systems, for the specification of software and for mathematically rigorous arguments about program properties.","This course studies the standard models for the layered approach to communication between autonomous machines in a network, and the main characteristics of data transmission across various physical link types."
0.9126,"The following areas of study constitute the backbone of the course. Predicate calculus and natural deduction, inductive definitions of data types as a basis for recursive functions and structural induction, formal language theory (particularly regular expressions, finite state machines and context free grammars), and specification languages.","It considers how to design networks and protocols for diverse situations, analyses several application and support protocols from a distributed systems viewpoint, and identifies significant problem areas in networked communications."
0.9033,"Apply the concepts of standard mathematical logic to produce proofs or refutations of well-formed propositions or arguments phrased in English or in a variety of formal notations (first order logic, discrete mathematics or Hoare Logic).","It considers how to design networks and protocols for diverse situations, analyses several application and support protocols from a distributed systems viewpoint, and identifies significant problem areas in networked communications."
0.8521,"Given a description of a regular language, either in English, as a regular expression or as a grammar, generate a finite state automaton that recognizes that language. Similarly, given a deterministic or nondeterministic automaton, give a description of the language which it accepts.","This course studies the standard models for the layered approach to communication between autonomous machines in a network, and the main characteristics of data transmission across various physical link types."
0.8957,"Given an inductive definition of a simple data structure, write a recursive definition of a given simple operation on data of that type. Given some such recursively defined operations, prove simple properties of these functions using the appropriate structural induction principle.","This course studies the standard models for the layered approach to communication between autonomous machines in a network, and the main characteristics of data transmission across various physical link types."
0.8923,Prove simple programs correct using Hoare Logic.,"It considers how to design networks and protocols for diverse situations, analyses several application and support protocols from a distributed systems viewpoint, and identifies significant problem areas in networked communications."
0.8985,Design a Turing Machine which will accomplish simple tasks.,"It considers how to design networks and protocols for diverse situations, analyses several application and support protocols from a distributed systems viewpoint, and identifies significant problem areas in networked communications."
