0.8943,"This course takes a detailed look at the services provided by, and the internals of, an existing operating system to see how each part is constructed and integrated into the whole.","Demonstrate a conceptual understanding of database systems and architecture, data models and declarative query languages"
0.8916,The lectures will also address recent literature describing advances in operating systems.,Apply their knowledge to a given problem domain and articulate potential data analysis problems.
0.9255,"The following topics are addressed: system programming and its facilities (including I/O, signals, job control, interprocess communication, sockets, transport layers, remote operations), system calls and their relation to the system libraries, process management and coordination, implementation of message passing, memory management, interrupt handling, real-time clocks, device-independent input/output, serial-line drivers, network communication, disk drivers, deadlock avoidance, scheduling paradigms, file systems, security.","Tour the basic techniques of data science, including both SQL and NoSQL solutions for massive data management, basic statistical modeling (e.g., descriptive statistics, linear and non-linear regression), algorithms for machine learning and optimization, and fundamentals of knowledge representation and search."
