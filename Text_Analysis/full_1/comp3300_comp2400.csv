0.9210,This course is an introduction to relational databases and the general skills for designing and using them.,"This course takes a detailed look at the services provided by, and the internals of, an existing operating system to see how each part is constructed and integrated into the whole."
0.9427,"The topics include the relational data model, SQL, entity-relationship model, functional dependencies, (de-)normalisation, relational algebra, query processing and optimisation, database transactions and security.","The following topics are addressed: system programming and its facilities (including I/O, signals, job control, interprocess communication, sockets, transport layers, remote operations), system calls and their relation to the system libraries, process management and coordination, implementation of message passing, memory management, interrupt handling, real-time clocks, device-independent input/output, serial-line drivers, network communication, disk drivers, deadlock avoidance, scheduling paradigms, file systems, security."
0.9314,"To deepen the understanding of relational databases, the current industry development of database systems such as NoSQL databases will be introduced at the end of this course.",The lectures will also address recent literature describing advances in operating systems.
0.9098,Describe the basic concepts of the relational model and understand its mathematical foundation;,identify and describe the reasons for many architectural features of contemporary machines.
0.8762,"Use the SQL language to define, query and manipulate a relational database.",describe and analyse the actual algorithms and data structures that are used in a particular operating system.
0.9073,Apply conceptual database modelling methods such as entity-relationship model to design a relational database.,"define and analyse the structure of operating systems in general, especially those that support communicating processes."
0.9278,Apply database design methods on functional dependencies and normal forms to evaluate the quality of a relational database design.,"identify and evaluate features of the system library of a particular operating system, and be able to apply this knowledge to program small applications."
0.9114,"Understand query processing and optimization, transaction and security management in a relational database management system.","The following topics are addressed: system programming and its facilities (including I/O, signals, job control, interprocess communication, sockets, transport layers, remote operations), system calls and their relation to the system libraries, process management and coordination, implementation of message passing, memory management, interrupt handling, real-time clocks, device-independent input/output, serial-line drivers, network communication, disk drivers, deadlock avoidance, scheduling paradigms, file systems, security."
0.8928,"Understand the state of the art of database management systems, and big data management challenges (Amazon's Dynamo, Google's BigTable, MongoDB and MapReduce).","The following topics are addressed: system programming and its facilities (including I/O, signals, job control, interprocess communication, sockets, transport layers, remote operations), system calls and their relation to the system libraries, process management and coordination, implementation of message passing, memory management, interrupt handling, real-time clocks, device-independent input/output, serial-line drivers, network communication, disk drivers, deadlock avoidance, scheduling paradigms, file systems, security."
