0.8933,"This course presents some formal notations that are commonly used for the description of computation and of computing systems, for the specification of software and for mathematically rigorous arguments about program properties.","This is an advanced undergraduate course that covers advanced topics in Artificial Intelligence. Topics vary from one offering to the next and are likely to be drawn from the following list: planning, scheduling, games, search, reasoning (constraint-based, model-based, spatial, temporal), knowledge representation, decision-making under uncertainty, reinforcement learning, agents, foundations."
0.9324,"The following areas of study constitute the backbone of the course. Predicate calculus and natural deduction, inductive definitions of data types as a basis for recursive functions and structural induction, formal language theory (particularly regular expressions, finite state machines and context free grammars), and specification languages.","This is an advanced undergraduate course that covers advanced topics in Artificial Intelligence. Topics vary from one offering to the next and are likely to be drawn from the following list: planning, scheduling, games, search, reasoning (constraint-based, model-based, spatial, temporal), knowledge representation, decision-making under uncertainty, reinforcement learning, agents, foundations."
