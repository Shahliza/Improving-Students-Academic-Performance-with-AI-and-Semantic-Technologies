0.9010,"Software Security covers advanced techniques in software vulnerability assessment, discovery and mitigation.","Develop, understand, test, and evolve substantial programs using a modern IDE, and associated configuration tools; understand common coding errors and how to avoid them; practice fundamental defensive programming; perform individual and team program reviews; use established design principles to organize a software system."
0.9344,"These include: common patterns in software vulnerabilities, such as stack-based buffer overflow, format string vulnerabilities, and heap-based vulnerabilities; exploitation techniques such as code injection, return-oriented-programming; techniques for vulnerability discovery, such as program binaries reverse engineering, fuzzing and symbolic execution; and mitigation techniques such as memory protection mechanisms, input sanitation, and control flow integrity protection.","Distinguish language definition from implementation, syntax and parsing from semantics and evaluation, understand how program state maps to memory (globals, local, heap), and understand the implications of heap reachability for memory management."
0.9534,"The course features hands-on lectures and labs to analyse software vulnerabilities, both in the source code and in program binaries, and design and implement appropriate mitigation techniques.","Develop, understand, test, and evolve substantial programs using a modern IDE, and associated configuration tools; understand common coding errors and how to avoid them; practice fundamental defensive programming; perform individual and team program reviews; use established design principles to organize a software system."
