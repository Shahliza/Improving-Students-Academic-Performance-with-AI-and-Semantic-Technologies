0.9113,"This course presents some formal notations that are commonly used for the description of computation and of computing systems, for the specification of software and for mathematically rigorous arguments about program properties.",Computational Methods for Network Science covers the essentials of using computational approaches to pose and answer social science research problems.
0.9045,"The following areas of study constitute the backbone of the course. Predicate calculus and natural deduction, inductive definitions of data types as a basis for recursive functions and structural induction, formal language theory (particularly regular expressions, finite state machines and context free grammars), and specification languages.",Computational Methods for Network Science covers the essentials of using computational approaches to pose and answer social science research problems.
0.9091,"Apply the concepts of standard mathematical logic to produce proofs or refutations of well-formed propositions or arguments phrased in English or in a variety of formal notations (first order logic, discrete mathematics or Hoare Logic).",Demonstrate a thorough understanding of the fundamental principles of using computational approaches to formulate and answer social science questions.
0.8349,"Given a description of a regular language, either in English, as a regular expression or as a grammar, generate a finite state automaton that recognizes that language. Similarly, given a deterministic or nondeterministic automaton, give a description of the language which it accepts.",In doing so it also covers a selected set of network algorithms in depth.
0.8924,"Given an inductive definition of a simple data structure, write a recursive definition of a given simple operation on data of that type. Given some such recursively defined operations, prove simple properties of these functions using the appropriate structural induction principle.","Analyze results from network algorithms, and articulate their limitations."
