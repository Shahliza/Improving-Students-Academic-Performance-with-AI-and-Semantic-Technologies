0.8810,"This course presents some formal notations that are commonly used for the description of computation and of computing systems, for the specification of software and for mathematically rigorous arguments about program properties.",This course introduces the construction of web sites and web interface/interaction design.
0.8929,"The following areas of study constitute the backbone of the course. Predicate calculus and natural deduction, inductive definitions of data types as a basis for recursive functions and structural induction, formal language theory (particularly regular expressions, finite state machines and context free grammars), and specification languages.","Topics such as the nature and types of multimedia objects, components of a multimedia system, Web authoring, delivery tools, multimedia applications, spam, podcasts, RSS, web spam and societal implications of the web. Students will create multimedia applications using some or all of HTML, XHTML, JavaScript, animation, sound, video and 3D."
0.8901,"Apply the concepts of standard mathematical logic to produce proofs or refutations of well-formed propositions or arguments phrased in English or in a variety of formal notations (first order logic, discrete mathematics or Hoare Logic).","Understand and be able to develop and design web sites including multimedia content by applying current web design principles, guidelines and heuristics."
0.8253,"Given a description of a regular language, either in English, as a regular expression or as a grammar, generate a finite state automaton that recognizes that language. Similarly, given a deterministic or nondeterministic automaton, give a description of the language which it accepts.","Topics such as the nature and types of multimedia objects, components of a multimedia system, Web authoring, delivery tools, multimedia applications, spam, podcasts, RSS, web spam and societal implications of the web. Students will create multimedia applications using some or all of HTML, XHTML, JavaScript, animation, sound, video and 3D."
0.8671,"Given an inductive definition of a simple data structure, write a recursive definition of a given simple operation on data of that type. Given some such recursively defined operations, prove simple properties of these functions using the appropriate structural induction principle.","Understand and be able to develop and design web sites including multimedia content by applying current web design principles, guidelines and heuristics."
0.8919,Prove simple programs correct using Hoare Logic.,"Understand and be able to develop and design web sites including multimedia content by applying current web design principles, guidelines and heuristics."
0.8848,Design a Turing Machine which will accomplish simple tasks.,"Understand and be able to develop and design web sites including multimedia content by applying current web design principles, guidelines and heuristics."
