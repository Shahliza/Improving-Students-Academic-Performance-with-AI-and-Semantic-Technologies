0.9123,Artificial intelligence is the science that studies and develops methods of making computers more /intelligent/.,It introduces students to the field of computer science as a discipline for solving problems through computation and provides the foundation for more advanced courses on programming and software development.
0.9424,"The focus of this course is on core AI techniques for search, knowledge representation and reasoning, planning, and designing intelligent agents.",It introduces students to the field of computer science as a discipline for solving problems through computation and provides the foundation for more advanced courses on programming and software development.
0.9251,"The course also aims to give an overview of the historical, philosophical, and logical foundations of AI.","The course also introduces imperative programming as an alternative paradigm to functional programming, highlighting similarities and contrasting differences."
