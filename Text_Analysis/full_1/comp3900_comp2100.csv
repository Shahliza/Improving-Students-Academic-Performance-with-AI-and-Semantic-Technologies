0.9399,"This course continues to build on topics taught in the previous two courses. It focuses on construction of medium scale programs, using design patterns and tools that are used in the software development process.","The course will equip students with theory, methods, and techniques to investigate different design situations, develop novel design ideas, and ask critical questions about the role of technology in society."
0.9200,Students will gain further experience with industry standard revision control and integrated development environment (IDE) tools.,"This course will provide an introduction to the field of Human-Computer Interaction and will introduce students to key interaction and experience design paradigms, approaches and methods."
0.9142,"Students will learn appropriate application of programming abstractions they have learned in previous courses to the structuring of medium scale software: inheritance, generic types, polymorphism, procedural abstraction, and abstract recursive data structures (including abstract syntax trees as a program representation, and tools that manipulate them).","The course will equip students with theory, methods, and techniques to investigate different design situations, develop novel design ideas, and ask critical questions about the role of technology in society."
0.8955,"The course also covers more advanced data structures, such as priority queues, B-trees, red-black trees, and AVL trees, and deepens understanding of appropriate algorithmic strategies.","The course will equip students with theory, methods, and techniques to investigate different design situations, develop novel design ideas, and ask critical questions about the role of technology in society."
0.9288,The course also treats intellectual property considerations in software development and deployment.,"Investigate the activities and practices of a design space using design research methods, to identify opportunities and issues for design intervention."
