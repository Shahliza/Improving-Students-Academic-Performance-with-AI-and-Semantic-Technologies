0.8897,Artificial intelligence is the science that studies and develops methods of making computers more /intelligent/.,"In this course students will learn about fundamental algorithms, data structures and programming models used in 3D graphics applications."
0.9453,"The focus of this course is on core AI techniques for search, knowledge representation and reasoning, planning, and designing intelligent agents.","In this course students will learn about fundamental algorithms, data structures and programming models used in 3D graphics applications."
0.9255,"The course also aims to give an overview of the historical, philosophical, and logical foundations of AI.",In this course students will explore these concepts through practical implementation in a modern computer graphics software context.
0.9051,"Identify problems that are amenable to solution by AI methods, and which AI methods may be suited to solving a given problem.","In this course students will learn about fundamental algorithms, data structures and programming models used in 3D graphics applications."
0.9097,"Formalise a given problem in the language/framework of different AI methods (e.g., as a search problem, as a constraint satisfaction problem, as a planning problem, etc).","These key concepts in computer graphics programming will be covered from their mathematical foundations through to their application in domains such as data visualisation, virtual reality, computer games and film animation/VFX."
0.9125,"Implement basic AI algorithms (e.g., standard search or constraint propagation algorithms).","In this course students will learn about fundamental algorithms, data structures and programming models used in 3D graphics applications."
0.9204,"Design and perform an empirical evaluation of different algorithms on a problem formalisation, and state the conclusions that the evaluation supports.",In this course students will explore these concepts through practical implementation in a modern computer graphics software context.
