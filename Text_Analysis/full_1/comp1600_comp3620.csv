0.8886,Artificial intelligence is the science that studies and develops methods of making computers more /intelligent/.,Design a Turing Machine which will accomplish simple tasks.
0.9150,"The focus of this course is on core AI techniques for search, knowledge representation and reasoning, planning, and designing intelligent agents.","The following areas of study constitute the backbone of the course. Predicate calculus and natural deduction, inductive definitions of data types as a basis for recursive functions and structural induction, formal language theory (particularly regular expressions, finite state machines and context free grammars), and specification languages."
0.8867,"The course also aims to give an overview of the historical, philosophical, and logical foundations of AI.","The following areas of study constitute the backbone of the course. Predicate calculus and natural deduction, inductive definitions of data types as a basis for recursive functions and structural induction, formal language theory (particularly regular expressions, finite state machines and context free grammars), and specification languages."
0.9078,"Identify problems that are amenable to solution by AI methods, and which AI methods may be suited to solving a given problem.",Design a Turing Machine which will accomplish simple tasks.
0.9022,"Formalise a given problem in the language/framework of different AI methods (e.g., as a search problem, as a constraint satisfaction problem, as a planning problem, etc).","Apply the concepts of standard mathematical logic to produce proofs or refutations of well-formed propositions or arguments phrased in English or in a variety of formal notations (first order logic, discrete mathematics or Hoare Logic)."
0.9094,"Implement basic AI algorithms (e.g., standard search or constraint propagation algorithms).",Prove simple programs correct using Hoare Logic.
0.9178,"Design and perform an empirical evaluation of different algorithms on a problem formalisation, and state the conclusions that the evaluation supports.","Given an inductive definition of a simple data structure, write a recursive definition of a given simple operation on data of that type. Given some such recursively defined operations, prove simple properties of these functions using the appropriate structural induction principle."
