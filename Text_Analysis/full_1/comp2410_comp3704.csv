0.9145,"This course covers a range of concepts, techniques and technologies in network security.","In this course, you will learn fundamental concepts of data communication and networking in addition to gaining a working knowledge of network scalability, mobility, security, and managing capabilities."
0.9036,"This includes an overview of relevant network protocols and cryptography; analyses of designs and implementations of security protocols, including basic tools and techniques; an understanding of network threats and attacks such as eavesdropping, spoofing, protocol failures, DoS attacks and man-in-the-middle attacks; network defence including threat analysis and identification, architecture control, intrusion detection and layered security.","Analyse the role of network standards, protocols, and layered models."
0.9403,"The course features hands-on lectures and labs to analyse network vulnerabilities, and design and implement appropriate defensive techniques.","You will also develop a working knowledge of measuring risks and security threats and considering network monitoring and management procedures. Finally, you will build an ethics awareness and the communication skills needed to apply these networking concepts to a range of real-life analytical scenarios."
