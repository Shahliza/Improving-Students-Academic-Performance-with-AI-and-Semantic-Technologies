0.8831,"Massive amounts of data are being collected by public and private organisations, and research projects, while the Internet provides a very large source of information about almost every aspect of human life and society.","This course continues to build on topics taught in the previous two courses. It focuses on construction of medium scale programs, using design patterns and tools that are used in the software development process."
0.9096,Analysing such data can provide significant benefits to an organisation.,The course also treats intellectual property considerations in software development and deployment.
0.9441,This course provides a practical focus on the technology and research in the area of data mining.,"This course continues to build on topics taught in the previous two courses. It focuses on construction of medium scale programs, using design patterns and tools that are used in the software development process."
0.9162,It focuses on the algorithms and techniques and less on the mathematical and statistical foundations.,Apply fundamental programming concepts for medium scale programs.
0.9285,Critically analyse and justify the steps involved in the data mining process.,"Contrast the concepts of copyright, patenting, and trademarks as mechanisms for protecting intellectual property, within the legal context for these mechanisms;  understand, analyse, and evaluate ethical/social tradeoffs in technical decisions, evaluating stakeholder positions."
0.9239,Anticipate and identify data issues related to data mining.,Explain how system components contribute to performance; understand Amdahl’s law and its limitations; design and conduct performance experiments; use software tools to profile and measure program performance
0.9288,Test and apply the principal algorithms and techniques used in data mining.,"Use, implement, and evaluate more advanced data structures and associated algorithms; discuss factors other than computational efficiency for evaluating software; create, implement, debug, and evaluate algorithms for solving problems, including recursively, using divide-and-conquer, and via decomposition; implement an abstract data type; analyse design and implementation alternatives."
0.9261,Justify suitable techniques to use for a given data mining problem.,Apply fundamental programming concepts for medium scale programs.
0.9238,Appraise and reflect upon the results of a data mining project using suitable measurements.,Explain how system components contribute to performance; understand Amdahl’s law and its limitations; design and conduct performance experiments; use software tools to profile and measure program performance
0.9217,Reflect upon ethical and social impacts of data mining.,The course also treats intellectual property considerations in software development and deployment.
