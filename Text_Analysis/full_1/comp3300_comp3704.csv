0.9066,"This course covers a range of concepts, techniques and technologies in network security.","This course takes a detailed look at the services provided by, and the internals of, an existing operating system to see how each part is constructed and integrated into the whole."
0.9171,"This includes an overview of relevant network protocols and cryptography; analyses of designs and implementations of security protocols, including basic tools and techniques; an understanding of network threats and attacks such as eavesdropping, spoofing, protocol failures, DoS attacks and man-in-the-middle attacks; network defence including threat analysis and identification, architecture control, intrusion detection and layered security.","The following topics are addressed: system programming and its facilities (including I/O, signals, job control, interprocess communication, sockets, transport layers, remote operations), system calls and their relation to the system libraries, process management and coordination, implementation of message passing, memory management, interrupt handling, real-time clocks, device-independent input/output, serial-line drivers, network communication, disk drivers, deadlock avoidance, scheduling paradigms, file systems, security."
0.9219,"The course features hands-on lectures and labs to analyse network vulnerabilities, and design and implement appropriate defensive techniques.","identify and evaluate features of the system library of a particular operating system, and be able to apply this knowledge to program small applications."
