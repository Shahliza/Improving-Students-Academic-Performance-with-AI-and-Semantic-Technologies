0.9109,This course provides a broad but thorough introduction to the methods and practice of statistical machine learning.,We will build on previous programming courses to deepen and broaden students' knowledge and understanding of the practices and tools used to build large software systems within complex environments.
0.8818,"Topics covered will include Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood modeling; regression, classification, density estimation, clustering, principal and independent component analysis; parametric, semi-parametric, and non-parametric models; basis functions, neural networks, kernel methods, and graphical models; deterministic and stochastic optimisation; overfitting, regularisation, and validation.","Knowledge, practices and tools considered in this course will include process models, requirements engineering, design, modelling and user experience."
0.8762,"Describe a number of models for supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement machine learning.","We will use real-world examples such as distributed, high-integrity, web-based systems where rigorous software engineering can demonstrably enhance business value."
0.8845,Assess the strength and weakness of each of these models.,This will be achieved by introducing students to important design methodologies.
