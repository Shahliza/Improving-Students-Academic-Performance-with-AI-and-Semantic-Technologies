0.8991,"Software Security covers advanced techniques in software vulnerability assessment, discovery and mitigation.","In this course, you will learn fundamental concepts of data communication and networking in addition to gaining a working knowledge of network scalability, mobility, security, and managing capabilities."
0.8873,"These include: common patterns in software vulnerabilities, such as stack-based buffer overflow, format string vulnerabilities, and heap-based vulnerabilities; exploitation techniques such as code injection, return-oriented-programming; techniques for vulnerability discovery, such as program binaries reverse engineering, fuzzing and symbolic execution; and mitigation techniques such as memory protection mechanisms, input sanitation, and control flow integrity protection.",Create a virtual machine and apply tools for packet analysis and file encryption in a lab environment.
0.9261,"The course features hands-on lectures and labs to analyse software vulnerabilities, both in the source code and in program binaries, and design and implement appropriate mitigation techniques.","You will also develop a working knowledge of measuring risks and security threats and considering network monitoring and management procedures. Finally, you will build an ethics awareness and the communication skills needed to apply these networking concepts to a range of real-life analytical scenarios."
