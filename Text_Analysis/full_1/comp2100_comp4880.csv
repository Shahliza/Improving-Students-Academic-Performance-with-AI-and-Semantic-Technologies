0.9230,In doing so it also covers a selected set of network algorithms in depth.,Apply fundamental programming concepts for medium scale programs.
0.9279,"This includes random graph models, homophily and friendship paradox, influence and contagion in networks, markets and network games, network resilence.","The course also covers more advanced data structures, such as priority queues, B-trees, red-black trees, and AVL trees, and deepens understanding of appropriate algorithmic strategies."
0.9242,"Furthermore, it also teaches students about the ethics of doing data-driven social science research.",The course also treats intellectual property considerations in software development and deployment.
0.9330,The course equips the students with in-depth knowledge and hands-on experience in working with network data to study social processes at both the individual and aggregate levels.,"This course continues to build on topics taught in the previous two courses. It focuses on construction of medium scale programs, using design patterns and tools that are used in the software development process."
