This course covers a range of concepts, techniques and technologies in network security. 
This includes an overview of relevant network protocols and cryptography; analyses of designs and implementations of security protocols, including basic tools and techniques; an understanding of network threats and attacks such as eavesdropping, spoofing, protocol failures, DoS attacks and man-in-the-middle attacks; network defence including threat analysis and identification, architecture control, intrusion detection and layered security.
The course features hands-on lectures and labs to analyse network vulnerabilities, and design and implement appropriate defensive techniques.
