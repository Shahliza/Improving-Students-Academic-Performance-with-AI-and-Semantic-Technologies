This course studies the standard models for the layered approach to communication between autonomous machines in a network, and the main characteristics of data transmission across various physical link types. 
It considers how to design networks and protocols for diverse situations, analyses several application and support protocols from a distributed systems viewpoint, and identifies significant problem areas in networked communications.
Topics include: communication network architectures, signalling and modulation across physical media, real-world local and wide-area networks, internet protocol fundamentals, performance and monitoring of networks, routing, network security, and application protocols for distributed systems including web, email, video, internet-of-everything and other contemporary network topics.
Understand and describe the layered protocol model.
Describe, analyse and compare a number of datalink, network, and transport layer protocols.
Program network communication services for client/server and other application layouts.
Describe and analyse various related technical, administrative and social aspects of specific computer network protocols from standards documents and other primary materials found through research.
Design and/or analyse networks and services for homes, data centres, IoT/IoE, LANs and WANs.
