Computer graphics are an essential part of modern software. 
In this course students will learn about fundamental algorithms, data structures and programming models used in 3D graphics applications. 
These key concepts in computer graphics programming will be covered from their mathematical foundations through to their application in domains such as data visualisation, virtual reality, computer games and film animation/VFX. 
In this course students will explore these concepts through practical implementation in a modern computer graphics software context.
Explain the stages of a modern, hardware-accelerated 3D rendering pipeline
Construct and manipulate complex models, geometries and scene graphs in both 2D and 3D
Implement computer graphics algorithms in a shader language
