Computational Methods for Network Science covers the essentials of using computational approaches to pose and answer social science research problems. 
In doing so it also covers a selected set of network algorithms in depth. 
This includes random graph models, homophily and friendship paradox, influence and contagion in networks, markets and network games, network resilence. 
Furthermore, it also teaches students about the ethics of doing data-driven social science research.
The course equips the students with in-depth knowledge and hands-on experience in working with network data to study social processes at both the individual and aggregate levels. 
Graduates will be equipped with the technical, theoretical and conceptual skills and knowledge to start a budding career in this field of research.
Demonstrate a thorough understanding of the fundamental principles of using computational approaches to formulate and answer social science questions.
Demonstrate a working understanding in the ethical concerns of data drive analysis and experiments in human behavior.
Apply network analysis algorithms in practical contexts.
Analyze results from network algorithms, and articulate their limitations.
Communicate the process of formulating and solving computational social science problems to a team of professionals with computing and/or social sciences.
