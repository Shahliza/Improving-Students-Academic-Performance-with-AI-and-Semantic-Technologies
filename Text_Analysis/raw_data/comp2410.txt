Data communications and computer networking systems are growing rapidly in both size and function. It is impossible to think of a successful business day without the Internet. 
Modern communication technologies such as WiFi, Bring Your Own Device (BYOD), and Internet of Things (IoT) help us to stay connected with our family, friends, and work regardless of present location. 
Networked Information Systems (NISs) are becoming an essential part of everyday experiences, in our kitchen appliances, cars, and public transport and for Internet banking and shopping. 
Because they can make or break a day, understanding how networks work, and how they should be set up and managed to for reliability, scalability, mobility, and security is of the utmost importance to us.
In this course, you will learn fundamental concepts of data communication and networking in addition to gaining a working knowledge of network scalability, mobility, security, and managing capabilities. 
You will have the foundational basis to understand, evaluate, and compare new technologies and their applications. 
You will also develop a working knowledge of measuring risks and security threats and considering network monitoring and management procedures. Finally, you will build an ethics awareness and the communication skills needed to apply these networking concepts to a range of real-life analytical scenarios.
Discuss how network applications and their components work in real-life socio-economic, ethical, and legal contexts and evaluate their risks.
Analyse the role of network standards, protocols, and layered models.
Apply network design principles, topologies, architectures, and their components.
Apply logical and physical networks at levels from the local area to the Internet.
Create a virtual machine and apply tools for packet analysis and file encryption in a lab environment.
