Real-time and embedded systems are all around us. Controlling cars, trains, or aeroplanes, as well as mobile phones, cameras, or A/V equipment, embedded systems are a challenging and demanding part of computer science and engineering. 
This course delivers foundations of real-time analysis and implementation of systems which are interconnected with the physical world (embedded systems). 
It also delivers the principles of fault tolerant systems and highly reliable systems. 
Techniques which are introduced include real-time calculus, real-time scheduling, elementary sensor data filtering and fusion methods, error recovery strategies, and graceful degradation methods.
Formulate real-time constraints.
Employ standard real-time programming constructs.
Develop a concept to handle the requests level of reliability.
Construct and implement an architecture for an asynchronous, distributed real-time system.
Understand and consider constraints from physical dynamical systems.
Participate significantly in the enhancement of the reliability (or analysis) of safety critical systems.
